<h2><span class="smcap">Under the Law</span></h2>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="center">ACTION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> streets between Willow Roads and the little
town of Morris on the Hudson were still corrugated
with March thaw. But the sun shone warmly and
there was the wet smell of oncoming spring in the air.
Women flung open their coats at the neck; children
skipped lightly to school. The river took on an ethereal
light that to the shadmen meant the time when
their soggy boats would be moored to the long lines of
stakes near the channel. The country highways were
less hopeless with mud, and the spring tramp began
appearing at back doors.</p>

<p>A girl, driving her car rather absently through the
unimaginative streets of Morris, stopped suddenly at
sight of a ring of loafers gathered by the curb in a side
street, jeering mildly and apparently baiting a tumbled
heap of something in the gutter. What was it? A
dog? A child? Sard Bogart, her brown eyes alert,
sprang from her car and went over to see.</p>

<p>As the girl approached the group, one or two of the
older and better dressed townspeople edged rather
shamefacedly away. The village postman, hailing
the girl loquaciously, explained, "Just one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Gloomy Guses. They come out like turtles this time
of the year. This feller has likely stole a ride on a
freight car and been dumped off at West Morris.
Seems he's trying to pertend he don't know who he is.
That ain't hard for a tramp; ain't nobody anyhow."
The postman scratched his head, wishing to cover all
aspects of the matter. "Ef he's drunk, it's a new
kind of drunk. Vanilla extract, they tell me, is what
this kind boozes on nowadays." To the girl's indignant
question, "Oh, they ain't doing him no harm;
just worrying him a little to see him act funny. The
authorities?" the postman looked a little vague.
"Well, I should say, it being about noon, that the
authorities has gone home to their dinners."</p>

<p>The young figure crossed the street and approached
the jeering loafers absorbed in prodding the helpless
bundle of humanity in the gutter. They shoved it
from side to side as they demanded, "Say, where's
yer wife? Where'd ye come from? We'll tell yer
where to get off! Say, Jack, where do you keep the
stuff? You tell me, I won't let anybody know."</p>

<p>More comments of a humorous nature were made
for the benefit of the girl approaching. "He ain't so
handsome when ye come close up." One wag hushed
the others elaborately. "No, mebbe it's some friend
of this young lady's. Say, take him for a ride, Miss.
I'll bet he ain't never had one."</p>

<p>"Give him a shave first," urged one gum-chewing
youth. There was violent nudging from a rather
stout woman in the group. "Shut up! Ain't you got
no sense? That's Judge Bogart's daughter." Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to railing unbelief, "Sure it is. Ain't I washed down
to her house a hundred times? Hullo, Miss Bogart,
ain't it terrible how these fellers is treating that poor
drunk?"</p>

<p>At the voice, the girl lifted her concerned gaze from
the sight of the wretched figure sitting now on the
curbstone, both bleeding shoe-wrecked feet in the
gutter.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Croyder, this is pitiful. Why doesn't someone
do something? Why do the authorities permit
people to be tormented like this?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Croyder, as one not accustomed to question the
vagaries of the authorities, was a little vague.</p>

<p>"Well, now, Mr. Snowgen, that's the policeman,
wouldn't never hear to anything like it, but he's gone
home to his dinner."</p>

<p>"Then the traffic police?" The girl looked about
her eagerly.</p>

<p>"They've gone home to their dinners,"</p>

<p>"But surely&mdash;&mdash;" With an impatient exclamation
the girl bent down in the middle of the awed circle
and looked keenly into the face of the vagabond on
the curb. She examined the bleeding feet and pale,
distraught face and spoke very gently. "Can I help
you?"</p>

<p>The soft girlish tones seemed hardly to penetrate to
the consciousness of the tramp. He did not look up
nor try to answer. At last, in response to the prodding
toe of a village gamin and his challenge, "Say,
ain't you got no manners? The lady is speakin' to
yer," the head, sunk between the shivering shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
was raised with a sodden, uncomprehending look.
Then the man, ragged, unshaven, with an unspeakable
look of abandoned misery, did a strange thing. He
struggled, shaking as with palsy, to his feet. There
was a week's reddish growth of beard on his white
face; his voice, very feeble, stammered and was lost
in places, but he replied slowly, "Can&mdash;can you read
that name in my hat? Perhaps there is an address
there, I don't know. I can't remember." With a
hand like a claw, the tramp pointed to a wrinkled cap
lying in the gutter.</p>

<p>Sard, seeing him sway as though he would pitch forward,
put out an arm to steady him. At this, a
passer-by came up to her and, without a word, supported
the collapsing man on the other side. This
youth smiled sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do, Miss Bogart?"</p>

<p>The girl turned sharply. "Mr. Lowden," then with
a little air of relief, "this man seems dazed, sick.
Oughtn't we get help? Oughtn't we to do something?"</p>

<p>"Wait till Snowgen gets back from his dinner,"
bawled the chorus of loafers. A dozen voices advised,
"Snowgen will put him in the lock-up, and if
he can't prove anything, they'll send him up for vagrancy.
Here's his hat. No, ma'am, I wouldn't touch
it if I was you; that ain't no hat fer a lady to hold."
One of the group, with effects of delicate shrinking,
held the wretched headgear so that the girl could read
a name written with ink on a piece of tape stitched inside
on the lining. There were two initials smutted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
beyond recognition, but she could distinguish the surname
"Colter." With a curious little gesture of courtesy,
she bent to the pitiful figure she was helping support,
asking gravely and distinctly, "Mr. Colter, you
are in trouble. Can we help you? Is there anything
we can do for you?"</p>

<p>This courtesy to the forlorn scarecrow the crowd
found vastly amusing. The thing brought laughter
and the inevitable <i>double entente</i> of small-town
comprehension. At last someone said wrathfully,
"Shut up! Don't you know nothing? That there's
the Judge's daughter. She ain't no fool!" The
crowd, now avid for more sensation, watched to see
how the wastrel tottering there would take this thing.</p>

<p>The shaking hand was held out for the cap. Some
bystander with rough hand jammed it on the tumbled
head of thick auburn hair, but the tramp feebly removed
it. He turned slowly, staring into the girl's
face. His eyes, of a very intense blue, were large and
unnaturally bright, as from fever.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said weakly. Then with a swift
glance full of unnameable shame, "Please don't
worry about me. I am only going to find work&mdash;somewhere,"
The man closed his eyes, muttering,</p>

<p>"When I can forget&mdash;when I can remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sard Bogart turned to the youth who was helping
her. "Will you come with me?" she appealed.
He nodded.</p>

<p>"I am going to drive this poor thing to that little
boarding-house on Norman Street. I know the
woman who keeps it. It is quiet and clean."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The circle of loafers tittered. "Say, lady, wait till
Snowgen gets back from his dinner. Snowgen can
take the feller to the right boarding-house, all
right."</p>

<p>The girl, for answer, smiled good-humoredly.
"Mr. Snowgen can interview this man after he has
been fed and can speak for himself. Just at present,
Mr. Lowden and I will take charge."</p>

<p>Lowden, the young assistant of the Morris Bank,
frowned on any more suggestions, and together the
man and girl supported the wretched figure to the car.
Together they somehow got it to a seat. Then the
young fellow watched Sard with admiration as she
calmly drove with her rather dubious-looking passenger
through the staring streets of Morris.</p>

<p>The girl was silent, and the young banker made but
one observation. "Small town life breeds a thirst for
sensation, doesn't it? It never gets mentally to the
economic questions lying back of the sensation."</p>

<p>"It is still the Binet Test, fourteen-year-old mind,"
laughed the girl.</p>

<p>As the car halted before the little boarding-house on
Norman Street, Lowden begged, "I wish you'd let me
handle all the rest."</p>

<p>The girl turned her eyes on him. "You think I
may meet with awkward things?"</p>

<p>The young banker was evasive. "Let's remember
we are rather a mean little town," he said simply.
"Please leave it all to me. I'll do exactly as you
say."</p>

<p>The girl's grave look rested on the wreck of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
sitting in a heap beside her, his head sunk on his chest,
his ragged coat open and showing his bare, famished-looking
chest, his white lips muttering feebly.</p>

<p>"I want him put to bed and fed&mdash;very lightly at
first. I want him bathed and shaved, after a doctor
has seen him. I want him either sent to the hospital
here at my expense or, when he is strong enough, to
come to my father for work. I want him to be sure,
sure, he has friends. I want him," the quick tears
came into her young eyes, "to feel that he has another
chance."</p>

<p>The youth nodded, his eyes on hers. This was Sard
Bogart, the Judge's daughter, who had been back from
college only a few months. It was understood in the
villages of Morris and Willow Roads that Miss Bogart
was a "queer," lonely girl, impatient of many things,
apt to be impulsive and to do impolitic and "unpopular"
things. This was one of the things&mdash;pulling a
muddy gutter-snipe out of the gutter. Yet the light
in the girl's clear brown eyes was a new and grateful
thing to the young bank officer. Somehow he felt as
if he had never looked into a fine woman's eyes before.
He took his orders gladly and with sober admiration.
"And keep me in touch, won't you?" The girl leaned
from the car, laying her commands on him. He lifted
his hat gravely.</p>

<p>Lowden alighted and helped down the ragged
vagrant. His gentleness was like Sard's own. The
girl, watching this gentleness, saw the broken figure
of the man try to turn once&mdash;try to look back at her.
"Yes?" said the girl "Yes?" Then her eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
warm with pity, "Wait a moment, please, Mr. Lowden.
Yes, Colter, what is it you want to say?"</p>

<p>But she could not understand. She saw only a
shaken, shivering man muttering, "I can't remember,"
and again the stammering sentence, "I can't remember."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class="center">UNDER THE LAW</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> house faced on the river. The massive hills
that turned bronze in the setting sun were irregular
background for the white castle-like buildings on the
eastern banks. But the western shore of the Hudson
had set between small mountains little, hilly-looking
villages; among them were the Dutch towns,
Morris and Willow Roads, whose old roofs, slowly
giving way to factories and churches of one period,
were at last disappearing before the real estate man's
idea of a suburban development. At the edge of this
development were the far-apart homes of the well-to-do
and the long lines of green lawns; the rich trees
and tinted shrubberies were illumined and laced with
a thousand lovely colors of massed iris and waving
tulips set, like the gardens on the river, against royal
purple of opposite shores.</p>

<p>Sard's room was in the square tower of the house
her father had built in his more grandiloquent days.
If the Judge's wife had lived, they might have lengthened
and strengthened the home into something like a
practical sunny house of our day, but as it was, the
curious construction of red sandstone and black and
white Tudor retained its perplexed conglomerate air,
only saved from freakishness by the soft mantle of
vines that ruffled the chimney and girdled its windows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
All around to the sloping banks of the river were the
trees that the Judge's father had planted and tended
into maturity. It was a League of Nations in Trees!
English maples, Norway spruces, lindens, horse-chestnuts
from Versailles, Japanese maples and Greek
planes and orange trees from along the Mediterranean.
To Sard, since her very first party dress, those
trees had seemed a sort of litany; the noble forms of
every clime and country raised their mysterious crests,
sought with yearning roots, were full of the first murmur
of June-bee days; waved like women the soft
undulations of their shapes, bathed in blue morning or
loomed in formless grandeur on the night.</p>

<p>It was a puzzle to Sard that these trees kept to the
laws of their growth in one soil.</p>

<p>The windows of Sard's room opened to the four
winds and gave on the tree-fringed expanse of water.
At night those tower panes were literally dashed with
stars. As a little girl she had lain watching their fairy
dance like fire-flies; later her clear brown eyes became
fixed thoughtfully on what seemed strings of jasmine-like
blossoms. Coming home from boarding-school,
the stars half thrilled her with mystical trailing blossoms
of a home-sky, but now of late, after college
and a new sense of values, these stars had suddenly
ceased throwing their soft lights across the panes.
East, west, north and south, they now stood in an
awful order like knights leaning on spears. They
were challenging in their geometry, severe in their
puzzling fixity; they seemed to say&mdash;"Well, Sard, you
are grown up now; you make your own choices;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
what is your law? We have our law&mdash;have you discovered
yours?"</p>

<p>During two years at college Sard had thought little
about "law." The stars there had asked few questions.
They had seemed companionable, dashing confidently,
shining over the campus with capricious
groups of girls; they had shone on bright camp-fires
and twinkled at the saucy songs shouted into their
very eyes. The college stars had seemed to vibrate
like sleigh-bells to such defiant songs as "Where, oh
death, is thy stingalingaling?" and they thrilled to a
thousand funny whistles and calls of a rather self-consciously
emphasized youth. But here they were
back with their spell and their question. Knights with
spears, they rode softly past the window-panes, keeping
their geometric order, saying, insistently&mdash;"This
is our law; we obey always. What is your law?"</p>

<p>At first the thing had awed Sard, then saddened her.
So after all, the world physical went on this grand
orderly, terrible sort of way, and so did the spiritual
world seem to, no matter how much one wanted to
change things; but the world of people and purpose?
how about that?</p>

<p>What should be the laws of one's life? The books
on Sard's shelves gleamed in the moonlight. Here
and there they had helped and suggested and one or
two men or women Sard had met seemed to have an
idea. Then this thing they called "Love"&mdash;Sard,
lying in bed, pondered; did love do what people said
it did, sweeten, make deeper, wiser? Well, Sard had
seen girls at college who became engaged, said they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
were in love, certainly were changed and made queer
by a force bigger than themselves; and yet it all
seemed to end trivially. One or two children, a little
house not very well kept, a tired husband, not
"enough" money ... and there were other
girls who mocked at love and played with it and coquetted
until their faces became cynical, hard and
horrible.... If there were things that swept
people so they rose bigger and finer than they had ever
dreamed themselves to be, that might count some way,
but how did they start becoming bigger and finer?
One couldn't go down-stairs and announce to one's
family&mdash;"From now on I am going to be bigger and
finer." So, tossing away from the star inquiry, turning
penitently back to it, the young form fought out
the thing. A sense of awful loneliness and youth came
to Sard, an awful sense of not knowing herself, not
working from the most inward of her. She stretched
out appealing arms&mdash;"What are my laws?" she asked
softly. "Oh, what are my laws?" For Sard knew,
and knew with feelings of awe that for every life that
counted there must be laws.</p>

<div class="center">BY-LAWS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Judge opened the door and propelled himself
into the room in a finicking, faultfinding way, peculiarly
inappropriate to his massive shoulders and head.
He grunted something to Sard's "Good-morning,
Dad," picked up his paper and flapped it into a fold.
His slow eyes, seeming like ground glass set in front
of the remorseless deliberations of his mind, paused
at the coffee-urn, as he made inquiry:</p>

<p>"Dunstan not down yet?"</p>

<p>For answer Dunstan Bogart shuffled down the broad
stairs and, slipping on a rug, entered the dining-room
with an operatic air of being in extreme haste. Half
tumbling into the room, he halted, dramatically, appearing
to remind himself that the breakfast-room was
holy ground. "Greeting to thee, fellow sufferers,"
he announced cheerfully. He made passes at his father's
back, stared his aunt solemnly in the face, ruffled
Sard's hair and finally took his seat.</p>

<p>"Frogs in the finger-bowls again?" he questioned
sepulchrally. "Else why all this gloom?"</p>

<p>The Judge, unnoticing, motioned his finished grapefruit
away. No one appearing to effect this transfer,
he indicated the butler's pantry back of him and Sard
felt anew for the electric bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder if this thing works&mdash;it doesn't seem to
ring in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"It is at present ringing in the chicken-coop and
the garage," announced Dunstan; "I heard it as I
dressed&mdash;it is ringing in the furnace and in the fountain;
it is ringing in Heaven, it is ringing&mdash;in&mdash;excuse
me."</p>

<p>The Judge, twitching the paper, looked at his son.
"She ought to hear it," he growled; "ring it again."</p>

<p>Dunstan suddenly dived under the table, feeling for
the button.</p>

<p>"Blame not the damsel," came the lad's voice, this
time near Sard's feet.</p>

<p>"Cuss the battery if you must cuss." He emerged
from under the table and catapulted into the kitchen,
where he nearly upset the cook, entering with a tray
of smoking Sally Lunn. His father followed him
with a cold eye of disgust.</p>

<p>"Does he think that sort of thing amusing?" he inquired.
The sacks under the Judge's dull eyes had a
slightly swelled, feverish look. The eyes themselves
were leaden gooseberry and boiled hard in the pupil.
The Judge's nose, aristocratic and sharp, held a fearful
look of pride, and the grizzled hair, scant on his
head, was heavy on ears and eyebrows. Sard had
often thought that the men and women brought before
her father must have had dread long before the
slightly nasal voice deliberately twanged out the sentence.
But as a little girl she remembered her mother
always said to her, "Baby, we love Foddie, don't we?
Foddie won't send <i>us</i> with the naughty pwisoners to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
pwison. Foddie won't take away all our nice toys and
put us in dungeons." There was invariably a smell of
cologne and little soft tickles of curls that went with
this, and a rustle of spreading ruffled silks and laces.
With these things, part of their pretty feminine play,
Sard could hear the whisper, that strange mother
whisper, the whisper which is back of the building of
the whole world, the whisper which is responsible for
the best men and the best women, for all greatness and
heroism and sometimes for the weakness and foolishness
and decadence&mdash;The Mother-whisper.</p>

<p>"We love Foddie, little Sard, don't we? We aren't
afraid of him&mdash;he won't send us to pwison." Then
over their own clasping had come the man's bear hug
and little laughs and screams from her pretty mother.
Then Sard had always gone gravely and happily away
to play.</p>

<p>Dunstan returned from the kitchen with the air of
news. "Cook hath secured the main part of the
breakfast booty, but thy maiden hath left&mdash;she answers
not to her name in the scullery."</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia Bogart, the Judge's sister, sighed
deeply. "Poor Dora, she never came in at all last
night&mdash;she&mdash;I&mdash;you&mdash;well, she is taking this thing
very hard&mdash;I suppose," with another sigh, "it is natural."</p>

<p>Dunstan grinned. "You are right, Aunt Reely;
right, delicate nun! It is not unnatural to be sad
when your only brother is indicted for murder. So
the fair nymph never came in at all last night? Queer
about these women." Dunstan winked at his sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
then stared blankly into his father's equally blank
face.</p>

<p>"I say, Pop, are you really going to jug him for
life, meaning the tow-headed murderer brother of our
esteemed waitress?"</p>

<p>The Judge turned. It might have been a veritable
mask of implacability that met the young brown faun-like
gaze turned toward it, except that plaster is tenderer
and softer than the human face devoid of the
emotions of the human heart. A human face controlled
by machine action is a terrible thing to see.
The Judge had for years been a machine.</p>

<p>Dunstan's own face reddened and turned away.
Sticking out his cup in the direction of the breakfast
urn, the Judge remarked curtly, "More sugar." Then
to his son, "I rather fancy your sort of levity is not as
amusing as you seem to think. It is merely underbred
and oafish, a sort of nigger minstrel's buffoonery."
The Judge paused a moment and then added coolly,
"As for what you wish to know, I am always ready
to talk with you on any subject that is not pure meddling
on your part."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;&mdash;" remarked Dunstan, with reverent aplomb.
"I heard the kitchen door bang; she's back. 'Tis well;
ring for hot muffins." With a curious glint of the
brown eyes, Dunstan looked back into the cold gaze
fixed upon him. But pure animal joy cannot long
survive the mortal ice of the glacial human spirit.
The dark eyes fell and the youth murmured thoughtfully,
<i>"and be hanged by the neck till you are dead"</i>.</p>

<p>Then the Judge rose and after they had heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
whine of his car swinging out of the drive, Sard and
her brother looked at each other. Together they had
noted the red eyes of the maid who, high-heeled of
shoe and extravagant of dark hair, had replenished the
muffins and brought back the coffee-urn.</p>

<p>"I don't envy you your job, Sard," Dunstan rose,
went to the glass and settled his tie. "You were a
gump not to go on with college and get a 'kayrear'
like the other flappers. 'Father needs you'&mdash;poof!
He needs nothing but that ice-box he calls himself.
By heck!" Dunstan turned suddenly. "Do you
know I believe it is sentencing people to death and the
Can that makes him like that? It&mdash;it does something
to him, don't you see?" But from his interest in the
idea Dunstan went to concern for his sister. "Aunt
Reely could run this joint. You go in for a career,
Sard, and get out from under."</p>

<p>His sister laughed. "After all, he's the only father
we've got, Dunce. Maybe after I've been around
home a bit&mdash;it seemed dreadful when Father wanted
me here not to come&mdash;for him to have nothing that
belonged to him." Sard frowned a little. "Don't you
think parents do an awful lot for us, and what do we
do for them? Look at poor little mother. I used to
visit for months at a time and leave her. She must
have been lonely&mdash;she never said so&mdash;and then those
two years at college and then&mdash;she went&mdash;&mdash;"
Sard's eyes widened with the sense of what those
lonely months had been&mdash;of the companionship she
herself had lost.</p>

<p>"Well," Dunstan loomed over her gloomily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
"you'll turn into an old maid, a wall flower, a sort of
solemn crow." He stood on his heels, hands in his
pockets, surveying her. "It's all of a piece," he said
fretfully. "You took down those bally chromos of
Paw's and you got pretty chintz for the chairs and put
around bright candles&mdash;and he hated it. You begged
him to let you cut windows into the hall and he
squashed you. You can't get sun and joy into this
house, and you can't get sun and human warmth into
that jellyfish." With a sudden squirm Dunstan struck
a match. "Oh, he's so plaguy sure," he growled.
"Law? law?&mdash;a lot of stuff in books brought down
from the funny old bigwigs in England&mdash;all scared of
their king; all hanging on to rotten things they called
'precedents' for fear somebody would get something
away from them; charters, burning of witches, dungeons,
strait-jackets, ducking-stools; Father belongs
to those days! Well," the young fellow turned upon
his sister fiercely, "they know no better, but you and
I do know better. We belong to a different age, and
we sit here comfortable and happy while our smug
parent does for a young fellow, a young blood-and-bone
man, full of grit and sap and dreams, a fellow
that could sail a boat and cut down a tree! We send
him to a filthy, smelly hell of a prison with a lot of
awful men!" Dunstan stopped. "I went through
State prison once, and the smell of it alone would rot
a man's soul&mdash;keep him hating good forever&mdash;you
realize it? A curly-headed fellow, a man younger
than I!"</p>

<p>The girl sitting soberly behind the silver coffee-urn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
looked wistfully at her brother. Dunstan's brown
face was long, and his ears just a trifle pointed like a
faun's; his voice was young and crackling, like a
tongue of young flame trying to push up through
heaped-up brush. He smoked silently, staring down
at his sister. "It's good-bye for him," he said slowly,
"good-bye to green trees and swimming in the pools
and climbing mountains and hearing a girl's voice.
Oh! to just being a man! Good-bye forever to everything
but smells and rats and the minds of decayed
men and we&mdash;you, Sard, and my father are doing
this thing."</p>

<p>Dunstan suddenly pushed back a chair. "Drat
parents!" he said fiercely, "drat law, drat the system,"
then he laughed. "Aunt Reely, don't shudder;
if a man on the stage talked that way, you'd think it
was lovely. Did you see my tennis racket?" demanded
Dunstan in his usual voice. "Oh, I guess I
jammed it in the rack of the car. Well, so long; don't
grieve for me if I don't turn up for lunch. I guess
I'll mess with Prudy Anterp and her bunch."</p>

<p>Sard and her aunt watched the light reedy figure
swing around the little footpath to the garage, and in
a few minutes Dunstan's car had glided out of sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class="center">OTHER LAWS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> years of college had done little to affect Sard
Bogart's life. True, those two years she had trodden
the athletic-social paths of the American academic
experience gaily, then the death of her mother called
her home. Her father's appeal made on the stark,
lonely night after the funeral had created circumstances
she had met four-square. From that time on,
Sard, with youthful heroism, had seen her life cut out
for her. She was to run the home and "keep things
bright" for her father.</p>

<p>There was also the Judge's sister, Miss Aurelia, of
the age always in conjecture, and of a curious beauty
that made poetry of an otherwise ineffective personality.
Miss Aurelia's small head was covered with
swathes of vital auburn hair, her delicate skin had
porcelain pinks and whites, and her soft eyes and slim
frame were of a curious suggestive quality that only
needed force and will to make her a vibrant, seductive
human creature. But this force and will were lacking.
Miss Aurelia had been reared altogether on the
"ladylike" plan. So while there was no look of
wear and tear on her, no wrinkles on her face, no gray
in her hair, and while her teeth were even, with the
effect of crowding her pursy mouth, yet all these signs
and colors of her spoke of untried, untested things;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
there was an eternal insecurity in her rabbity chin, her
soft apologetic voice, the tentatives of her conversational
method.</p>

<p>It was said in the village that Miss Aurelia "presided"
over her brother's house, and that Sard "ran"
it. However, there was no friction between the two.
Sard accepted Miss Aurelia with the same devotion
that she tended her mother's giant fuchsia, an unnecessary
trellised crime of thousands of purple and red
flowers, and refrained from sending away the chromos
that her father loved.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;er&mdash;telephone, my dear," Miss Aurelia came
softly up to Sard's tower room, "sorry to call you
but the&mdash;er&mdash;person&mdash;long distance&mdash;don't you ever
find it confusing?&mdash;I&mdash;they&mdash;she&mdash;the operator."</p>

<p>"Did you get the name?" asked Sard. "Is it
Minga Gerould?"</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia wondered if it was, paused, hesitated,
then, "Your curtains certainly do need freshening. I
never noticed it before. Yes, I think it may be Minga.
She&mdash;it&mdash;sounded husky, long distance, perhaps, I&mdash;they
seldom speak distinctly; the&mdash;er&mdash;operator was
extraordinarily uncivil,"&mdash;Miss Reely pursed her rabbity
mouth, "She&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Aunt Reely, yes, the curtains do need
laundering." Sard was out of the room and down the
stairs, the receiver at her ear. "Minga! you rascal!
Well, I am glad! Why didn't you write me, you little
trimmer&mdash;&mdash; No, ma'am, I did not&mdash;did you? Was
it nice? No, but I saw Cynthia and Gertrude, they're
back, bobbed hair and golf-sticks, bloom of youth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
their line this year. What are you laughing at?
No&mdash;is he?&mdash;to Cora Bland? Wasn't that like Cora&mdash;she's
going to finish? I wish I were&mdash;why? Oh,
that'll keep! Well, Cora is a good all 'round sport,
don't you think? She'll make Alpha, you see if she
doesn't&mdash;&mdash; What? Oh, Minga, don't ring off!
That's so, of course you have to pack; all right then&mdash;see
you to-night&mdash;so glad you are coming, don't forget
to sit on the right-hand side of the train coming
up, the river's wonderful as you come over the hill.
Bye-bye."</p>

<p>Sard, smiling, hung up the receiver. Not until this,
the first visit of a college pal since her mother's death,
had she felt her hunger for real companionship. Now
as she had done the first day she had left off her simple
mourning, she looked up at the portrait of her
mother hanging in the hall. She kissed her hand to
that curly, ear-ringed little lady. "Dear little dead
Mother," said Sard tenderly. "Dear little dead
Mother!" Instinctively she thought about the
mothers of the other girls of the town. Mrs. Bradon,
Cynthia's mother, fat, stupid and conventional. Gertrude's
mother, a hard practical woman with ambitions,
the other mothers as Sard knew them seemed
too girlish, crude, trivial, beside the little soft, curly,
ear-ringed lady that Sard had only just begun to look
at with woman eyes. "Would we have gotten on,
Mother dear, would we?" whispered Sard, wistfully.
"The other girls don't with their mothers."</p>

<p>Often Sard had been troubled by the guilty feeling
that had her mother lived&mdash;well, there might not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
been so much comradeship between them. Sard, clad
in her crisp, clean linen, with white low-cut shoes and
the plain little pin at her trim collar, remembered with
a sense of tender wonder all her mother's little fripperies
and gewgaws, the chains, the laces, and little
sets of jewelry and pins and dewdabs&mdash;how quickly
two years of camp and college had taught one of how
small account were these things!</p>

<p>It needed tenderness and humor, even that of a
very young girl, to get any real human life into a home
like the Bogart home. It had a stodgy gloom of its
own, a solemn, gloomy importance like the Judge's
step, his way of entering a room. The hall was dark,
the wainscoting was dark, the ceilings were gummy
with queer medallions and heavy, gemmy Georgian
ornaments. Of late years there had been extra electric
lights put in the hall and a fireplace added to the
living-room. These things gave a little cheer, as did
the brass candlesticks with the soft tawny or mellow
colored candles of Sard's own choosing. There was
distinguished silver in the dining-room and rows of
heavenly blue and pink willow plates in the cupboards,
just as there were graceful pieces of Majolica that
burned their hot color into the dull respectability of
the living and tea rooms, but these didn't help much.
Sard often shook her head over it all. She would
turn away from her mother's portrait to that of her
father when a young man. The then unbearded face
had a cold kind of virtue and strength, the uncovered
mouth was prim and uncompromising. Could it be
that Sard's home had somehow taken its color from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that prim mouth, those hard gooseberry colored eyes?
The girl went slowly to a mirror over the large fireplace
in the living-room. She pushed into the sunlight
a vase full of daffodils, the better to see her own
face.</p>

<p>"Funny! Where did you come from?" she asked
the girl in the mirror, then softly, as if it were almost
shameful to ask this question, "What are your laws?"</p>

<p>The dark brown eyes looked wistfully at Sard; the
forehead, a little high but square and harmonious, was
swept with a wave of golden brown hair that crisped
with vitality. The face seemed not interesting to the
girl who questioned it. "If I had more of Mother I
could do things with Father," she thought; "if I had
little curls and earrings that shook, and dimples and
queer little pudgy, patting hands. These do things to
men&mdash;and women, too. I've seen it happen."</p>

<p>Sard thought of girls she knew, girls grown up
with the new law, girls who finished at college, graduated
into doctors, lawyers, landscape gardeners, statisticians,
economists. She looked at her own hands,
long, thin, strong in the wrists, broadened and browned
from tennis, boating and golf and driving of machines.
Sard, however, did not see in the mirror the
thing that held the mystery of her life, the gift that
would bring all that was rightfully hers to her. Do
people ever think of this one gift of personality&mdash;for
instance, the mouth that your pirate uncle sent down
to you, <i>that</i> brought you the husband whom you had
to leave to save your children; there is the shrug of
your shoulders that came from your father's side&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>they
did that, those people back of your father, and
thus were able to throw off whole loads of care; that
curved little finger goes with the sensitiveness of your
mother's family. You will be hurt and raw from
things all your life with that finger! Yes, but you will
be also exultant, drunken, wild with the quintessence
of beauty, of the mystery and wonder that is all
through the dull, daily grind. Sard's unique gift was
the poise of her head. Here was an imperious quality
like that of a princess, here a curve of chin and backset
of the shoulders which was at the same time elastic
and defiant and challenging. A girl like this, of indomitable
pride, curious nerve, wonders at some of the
insults she receives from the thing this pride and
nerve bring to life in others; also she is sometimes
touched and wondering to find how others believe in
and trust her.</p>

<p>Oh! our ancestors!&mdash;brave, struggling, dreaming,
pathetic ancestors! How you struggled, how you
prayed and agonized, or were wild and wanton to send
your strange gifts down to us! Here's to you, Ancestors,
all of you! May we send you the best and
bravest of you on and as far as we can, we will do the
best we can with your gifts!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class="center">FOR LIFE</div>


<p>
<span class="smcap">The</span> kitchen of the Bogart House was a pleasant
room whose two doors opened out into a tidy latticed
vegetable garden and whose outer arrangement of entry
and drying yard were of the "save steps" description.
Sard and her mother had worked these things
out together, for at college, under one of the few
strong souls and true brains that are still left unmartyred
in American colleges, the girl had learned
practical ideals of what should be the attitude of the
employer to those who toil for his comfort. It was
Sard who had the kitchen walls painted a sunshiny
yellow, selected pretty rag rugs and placed bookshelves
and good reading lights in the room; it was she
who had insisted upon the lattices and ladyslippers and
morning-glory vines. All with the sense of her own
pleasure in them, though none of the people the Bogarts
employed seemed to care much for these things.
The young daughter of the house soon began to realize
that any bright sport-hat she herself wore, the set of
her skirts, the make of her shoes, interested Dora and
Maggie better than the books she tried to discuss with
them. The name of Edith Cavell did not thrill them
as did the name of the most recent screen actress.
They cared only, it seemed, to catch up with the joy
and pleasure of the life ahead of them. They seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
always to feel that the very stuff of life was arrayed
against them&mdash;and sometimes they had reason.</p>

<p>Now as the girl pushed aside the swinging door of
the old-fashioned "butler's pantry," she was half prepared
for the interrupted Irish sentences, the hot
questions and answers.</p>

<p>"Is it justice, I ask you; is it justice? To take
him now&mdash;only nineteen. When he's sort of wild and
notional by nature and traps set for him? Maybe he
dunnit&mdash;maybe he dunnit, but he keeps saying he ain't
done it. Oh, my God, my God, I don't know."</p>

<p>The girl stood before the two women in the kitchen,
the cook who, like Sard, wiped her hands and silently
handed her the ordering list.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Maggie," said Sard; then, her forehead
drawing together, "Dora, is there anything
new?"</p>

<p>The waitress with a gesture of dumb inability to
answer, turned away, and Sard, no asperity in her
voice, saw that it was to a resolutely turned back that
she was speaking.</p>

<p>"She blames me, somehow," the girl sighed, "as if
I could help it!"</p>

<p>"Please put the north room to air. Miss Gerould
arrives late in the afternoon&mdash;I think there isn't a
waste-paper basket in the room, so, Dora, will you
hunt one up, and see to all the electric bulbs, won't
you? And towels, the little embroidered ones&mdash;&mdash;"
Sard waited, half contemplating, thinking of reproof
for the back turned so rudely and obstinately toward
her direction, then she looked at the slight, slender fig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ure
in its gray gown, the apron tied so carefully and
delicately, the capless, pretty hair, and was conscious
suddenly of someone young like herself. Through
this veil of youth she saw what kind of sorrow it was
that bowed the head of the woman standing there;
something that she did not know was the most glorious
passion in the world beat up through Sard's heart into
her brain; it was the passion for humanity, for justice
and fairness for all. "Why should I be giving orders
to her when she is suffering? Supposing Dunstan were
in trouble and&mdash;and shame, and I had to take orders
from the very people that&mdash;&mdash;Dora&mdash;Dora," the
girl persisted, "is there nothing I can do?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, only dry coughing sobs. The
cook turned. "Ah, don't bother your head with it all,
dear. It ain't nothing to you&mdash;only, Gawd help the
poor thing! Er course," said the cook somewhat bitterly,
"we're all under this law; the boy done wrong;
he done awful, and they'll be able to prove it against
him, and your papa&mdash;well," the cook sighed, "only
he's young, a rill smart curly-headed young feller
and his chanst is gorn."</p>

<p>Then cook, with a curious rising howl, turned away
herself.</p>

<p>Wiping her eyes, the young waitress stonily piling
up the silver on the tray, let drop a fork. The girl
stood there looking at it. Sard tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it is Human Sorrow," she said awkwardly.
"I think we&mdash;we don't understand sorrow as well as
we ought to and I am quite powerless but Miss
Aurelia and I care, Dora."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl said it tremulously; already she was feeling
the awful gulf between a person who suffers tragedy
and that other who stands by longing to help. Also
Sard knew a kind of shame&mdash;for it seemed treachery
to her father and the equity he maintained, to say
more. What could words do? It was Sard's first experience
of the great naked fact of human sorrow and
shame; she knew that the only person who could help
Dora would be someone who had been through a wave
of tragedy like hers.</p>

<p>"Words," thought Sard hotly, "are disgusting.
We bandy them about and pile them up like money.
We exchange them like coin of the realm." The
young girl, clean and defiant of emotion as a young
animal, had no mature power, that amazing power
borne through sorrow and sympathy, the strange
power of the healing touch, else she would have
touched Dora's bowed head, put a comforting hand on
the heaving shoulder. She stood silent, then once
more said, helplessly, "Dora, don't you believe me,
that I do truly care?"</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a curious half shriek, the terrible
leap of human emotion through the breaking discipline
of lips and eyes&mdash;"Oh, I know you care&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
Miss Sard&mdash;but they'll jug him just the same&mdash;for
life&mdash;for <i>life!</i> His chanst is gorn."</p>

<p>Dora's voice then sank to a kind of moaning soliloquy.
"Oh, yes, that's what they all tell me; he's
killed a man, or they say he has "&mdash;the woman shot a
haggard look into the girl's face. "I've thought and
thought and I know from reading the papers and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that almost any rich man's son would get off," she
said it bitterly, "but that isn't it&mdash;it's something else,
it's that he's only done wrong once, and now he's got
to live and die with the worst&mdash;oh," moaned Dora passionately,
"they'd ought to be laws to save them that's
got wrong into them, not to smash 'em. For life, for
<i>life!"</i></p>

<p>No great poet could have crammed into one sentence
the thing that the weeping girl crammed into
these words&mdash;"for life." Gently Sard closed the
door and, hardly knowing what she did, tiptoed back
toward the front of the house. She looked out on the
late spring foliage, on the tulips and Japanese maples
a-quiver with June, on the purple fleur de lis and
peonies, dewy with color against the long sparkling
ribbon of the morning river ... against all that
virginal clean growth with its rapturous aspiration toward
the sky that feeds it, the girl heard the poor
human cry, "For <i>life</i>&mdash;for life!"</p>

<p>So this was actually happening! Life, a smooth velvet
delicious thing was going on in the front of Sard's
home&mdash;music, pleasure, ease and beauty, while in the
back part of it life was labor and anguish and shame!
This was the law under which Sard's parents and their
friends had lived contentedly, it was the law under
which she was expected to live contentedly. "I never
will," whispered the girl fiercely, "I never, never will;
these are not my laws, <i>I</i> am not 'under' the law."</p>

<p>Sard, slowly leaving the kitchen, came upon her
aunt. Miss Aurelia, with the finest and lightest of
dusters, was performing various rituals with the legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of table and chairs; now she moved one thin hand in
swirls over the piano top. "A piano collects dust so
strangely," she explained, as if the piano were a sentient
thing that made dust-collecting its object. "I've
always been so glad to do the dusting," remarked Miss
Aurelia for the hundredth time, "he&mdash;your father,
of course, never notices but she&mdash;we&mdash;not that I
want to criticise your mother, that would be impossible,
only she-we&mdash;at that time&mdash;that is to say&mdash;in
any emergency I would naturally; of course, some
servants were careful and others not. I had once,"
said Miss Aurelia, with the air of beginning a new
subject, "I had an&mdash;an aunt," she whispered the
thing mysteriously, "she&mdash;er&mdash;hated dust &mdash;&mdash; Sard,
you're twisting your ring&mdash;you look&mdash;is anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>Sard, motioning toward the kitchen, spoke in a low
voice. "Aunt Reely, that boy, Terence O'Brien, is
Dora's only brother; she helped educate him; there
isn't anyone but those two &mdash;&mdash; Isn't it too terrible?"</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia lifted a lamp off the table, dusted
where it had been and put it back again; in doing so
the silk shade toppled and fell. Miss Aurelia, frowning
and gasping, treated the incident like a catastrophe,
something to be met with firmness and an intake
of breath. When she had solemnly adjusted all
as it had been again, she took up the subject of dust.
"It's the open fires," she remarked gloomily; "sometimes
I think we should never have&mdash;a land where
there is no dust, that is how I always think of
Heaven! Yes, Sard, I know that&mdash;er&mdash;she&mdash;he, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
course, it was a regular murder, such as you read
about, he is, you see, a criminal, my dear, and that,
of course, makes you&mdash;me&mdash;us feel a natural revulsion."
Miss Aurelia stood up; the sunlight fell upon
her gown of a rather sentimental blue with white ruffles,
her fair white skin was noticeable even in the
bald morning light, her rabbity mouth somehow too
full of teeth, paused unctuously, with drama on the
subject in hand.</p>

<p>Sard, strumming a few chords on the piano, looked
thoughtfully at her aunt. "Shall I bring in some of
those big Japanese iris?" she asked. "Minga's coming
to-night, did I tell you? I want things to look
jolly. The old dear hasn't been here since that holiday
week before Mother" &mdash;Sard never could finish
the sentence&mdash; "Mother died. Do you suppose Father
will let us have the small sedan altogether?
Minga is used to her own car; she fusses with any
machine they've got."</p>

<p>Something that had been hanging on Miss Aurelia's
mind hung there still; this slangy sort of talk, the
planning for Minga Gerould's visit Aunt Aurelia
hailed with delight. This was more as it should be,
better than Sard's behavior since she had remained
home from college after her mother's death. It was
the kind of thing, some of it, that Miss Aurelia had
grown to believe in while she deprecated it. American
young girls, of course, came of a nobly material
race, everyone avowed that America was very great
and the fact of the young people having no manners
and no respect for age and no morals and no loyalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to life&mdash;well, Miss Aurelia thought it was only the
other countries who were jealous who said such
things. American young girls came of a nobly material
race. Americans were so practical, so anxious to
get ahead&mdash;everyone seemed so anxious that the young
people shouldn't be high-brow. But then Sard had a
queer, Miss Aurelia thought almost common, way of
noticing servants and poor people, their troubles and
all that. It wasn't good or even religious to think too
much. For instance, the new man on the place. Miss
Aurelia didn't think it quite nice or "young" to be
interested in him. Miss Aurelia had often spoken to
a fat, calm friend, Mrs. Spoyd, about these things, and
Mrs. Spoyd had sighed, "I know what you mean,
dear. Did you hear about the little Gringlon girl?
Well, of course, it may not be true. I heard it from
their dressmaker, but it seems she noticed everything
and&mdash;er&mdash;was crazy for all kinds of information. No,
dear, of course, Sard ought not to be noticing anything
but a good time at her age. Girls should only be interested
in a good time. They shouldn't be interested
in&mdash;er&mdash;unpleasant things."</p>

<p>So Miss Aurelia overlooked the slang. It was all
right for Sard to be a little slangy; so much better
than sitting up in that tower room and thinking about
murderers. It would make her more "popular" to
have Minga Gerould go to dances and such things
with her. "America is a wonderful country," said
Miss Aurelia to herself, "and I think it is our 'popularity.'
Have you ever noticed," to Mrs. Spoyd,
"how awful it is for an American girl or man not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
be popular? Don't you think that our great men like
Theodore Roosevelt and&mdash;er&mdash;Barnum, are just as
popular in Heaven as here?</p>

<p>"I think God meant us to be&mdash;er&mdash;popular, don't
you? Just see," added Miss Aurelia with a flash of
insight, "how unpopular all of our statesmen have
been who have been in any way unique or&mdash;er&mdash;unusual.
Americans, the good, patriotic kind, have always
been very popular."</p>

<p>"Yes, I always feel so sorry for a young girl who
isn't popular," purred Mrs. Spoyd.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry about that boy, dear, now," advised
Miss Aurelia, with all the mature effects of
voice and manner of the person who is not truly
grown up. "We do all we can to make the prisoners
what they should be, and I have heard that many
tramps&mdash;er&mdash;like to go to prison." She stood up,
sighing. "There&mdash;this room at last looks respectable;"
her narrow, rather smoky-dull eyes roved over
Sard. "Why don't you put on your turquoise sweater
and tam, the pretty one with the blue pompom? I
will look after everything. No, dear, I don't think
you'd better use the car without asking Brother."</p>

<p>"Will you ask him?" said Sard shyly.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> ask?" Miss Aurelia said nervously. "Why&mdash;you&mdash;he&mdash;I&mdash;don't
you think, Sard,"&mdash;with a kind of
reproachful righteousness&mdash;"don't you think it ought
to come from you, his daughter? Now I must see
about the laundry."</p>

<p>Sard was accustomed to these cheerful little exits
made with the bustling manner of one with much business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>on hand. When Miss Aurelia wanted to evade
anything&mdash;&mdash;Suddenly it flashed over the girl,
"Why, she's always like that, she&mdash;she&mdash;never meets
anything; she wouldn't discuss it with me that morning
I tried to talk with her about Colter. She has
pretended all along she didn't know about Colter, and
now, with Dora crying there, red-eyed while she serves
the meals, she tried not to know that&mdash;why," Sard's
eyes opened, "I'm old, she's young."</p>

<p>"I ought to be her aunt," said the young girl to
herself. "I ought to be sending her in a picture hat
with an organdy dress and blue sash to meet Minga."</p>

<p>The girl stood motionless in the center of the floor,
thinking. When youth begins to think and to think
clearly and hard with its brave young mind, it is time
for the world to take notice&mdash;Sard frowning at the
floor, spoke aloud:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's living Under the Law," she said
slowly, "I see what Dora meant; we live under a
made law, we don't build up on it, away from it, to a
better law; we just live, cramped, confined, ignorant,
stupid, under it&mdash;Under the Law, that's it!!!" Sard
laughed a little wonderingly. "I shall meet Minga
this afternoon and we will go motoring and laughing
over the country roads and Dunce will come home
and we'll all eat fudge and dance to the Victrola to-night,
and one or two of the bunch will come in and
we'll play Rookie and Cheat and Toddle Top, and
then at nine o'clock Minga will want a nut sundae,
and we'll all pile into a machine and slew around to
Dingman's and eat sundaes and then hoot along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
roads until a tire pops and we think it time to go to
bed, because under the law that is our privilege.</p>

<p>"But in that little top room Dora will wake up and
think about her brother, who, she says, is Under the
Law&mdash;&mdash;" Sard looked out of the open house door
toward the fleur de lis and the peonies, massed purple
and crimson against the silver sparkle of the river.
She stood gazing at the wealth and the shimmer of
spring leaves. "Why," said Sard slowly, "those
laws were only made for people who haven't grown
up; surely," said the girl to herself, "surely we were
meant to bring out of them other, better laws; why,"
said Sard, a deep light came into her long eyes with
their straight clear brown, "surely there are other
Laws! We can build above the Law, we don't need
to stay Under the Law."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class="center">MINGA'S LAWS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Minga</span> arrived in a spasm of long thin legs, short
skimpy skirt, a fluff of bobbed curls, a rather unnatural
whiteness of face, lugging a suitcase, golf
sticks and tennis racket with the independent gestures
of an experienced baggagesmasher. It was an
effect calculated to impress a girl's camp or a parcel
of immigrants, but as that of the arrival of a maiden
of eighteen summers at a quiet house in the little
center of Willow Roads, it was hardly distinguished.</p>

<p>The meeting of the two girls was a curious clinched
clasp done technically and punctuated by gasps, long,
over-emphasized kisses and such half-shrieked protests
as: "Oh, you dear brute, you're squeezing the
life out of me&mdash;You silly old darned duck&mdash;Oh,
Honey, isn't this great?" Then they fell apart, and
with mutual cool glance of appraisement took each
other in. As they turned talking and went up the
long stairs, Sard's look was laughingly interrogative.</p>

<p>"Minga, you've bobbed your hair."</p>

<p>"Yes, you like it? The Mede and Persian don't!
I had an awful row with the Mede, meaning Dad,
but he came around, of course."</p>

<p>Sard looked lovingly at the little curly head; she
felt of the thick knot at the back of her own young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
head and felt somehow old; she tossed it like an impatient
colt.</p>

<p>"It must feel nice."</p>

<p>"It feels like October wind blowing over the pink
heather," Minga laughed; she passed an arm around
the older girl. "Let's go up town and get yours done
right away. What do you want with hammocks of
long hair? Why, if Absalom had only had his hair
bobbed, the whole Bible would have been changed."</p>

<p>The voices of the girls had a curious cadence of
indolence, also a rising sense of potential shriek, yet
they were not raucous.</p>

<p>This was, however, merely cultivation that was unconscious;
other girls of their age who copied their
ways of wearing their sport-hats and "rolled" stockings
had not attained to the cool middle register of
these young tones, the pleasantly insistent quality of
the aimless dialogue. Yet all their movements, restless
and ungainly with curiously athletic emphasis,
seemed to correspond to their sentences, over-stressed
yet indifferent, while their young eyes, particularly
Minga's, under long-lashed, artificially penciled brows,
had hardness and clearness under which lay an everlasting
watchfulness.</p>

<p>It is with this watchfulness that the youth of to-day
betrays itself. Free from restrictions, from cares
and responsibilities, it yet has within it the potentialities
of these things. It unconsciously needs
standards, longs for them and has them not; therefore,
it unconsciously is seeking these standards, if
only in the wearing of clothes, in the foot work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
a tennis match, in new swimming strokes, in the use
of new words. Poor little youth of to-day longing for
values, saying with its strange wistful little face:
"Does she bob her hair?&mdash;then, I'll bob my hair.
Does she drink?&mdash;well then, I'll drink; does she sprawl
over and maul her young men friends?&mdash;well, then
I'll sprawl and maul."&mdash;Poor babies, not one of them
strong enough to carve a path of his or her own, all
led by the nose, trotting around after each other, all
with hats, neckties, turned-down stockings, bathing
suits, conventional stencils, voices and ignorance exactly
alike. Pathetic, wistful, funny, hungry little
American youth.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs stood Miss Bogart. "My
dear!" she held out two hands to Minga, who resolutely
seized them and with calm effect of masculinity,
gripped them until the lady's mouth twitched
with pain.</p>

<p>"This is nice," almost shrieked Miss Reely&mdash;she
also tried to put her arms around the young form, but
she might as well have tried to embrace the string of
a toy balloon. Minga, wafting along, recited some
sentences, with the rather easy-going cadence which
for a better name might be called "the chewing-gum
accent."</p>

<p>"Awfully nice to see you, Miss Bogart; Mother
and Father sent love. Isn't this great, though? You
and Sard were ducks to ask me. My faith, what a
jolly room." Minga peered into the adjacent bathroom.
"Swell mirror, <i>some</i> towels; do I use these
embroidered ones for cold cream?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you notice the view, dear, coming over the
hill&mdash;the river&mdash;the dogwoods?" asked Sard's aunt
complacently.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;er&mdash;view&mdash;&mdash;? Oh, yes, I remember now,
Sard said something; was it where they built that
new garage? Say, Sard, did you know that garage
is a big thing, the nippiest thing along the Hudson
River&mdash;this shore anyway? A lot of money went
into it. I know, because Father coughed up a few
shekels, to help the man out, you know, and he says
they are piling up coin already. He'll realize, all
right!"</p>

<p>Miss Reely, rather ignored by the two girls, fussed
about the room, settling a pillow sham, plumping up
a cushion. She turned back to the new arrival, who,
tossing her small provocative hat on the bed, turned
with an anxious frown to the mirror. "Girls," announced
Minga, unfastening her wrist-watch, "I'm
pale." From a small leather case in her pocketbook
she produced a tiny golden box of color, dabbed a
bit of it on each young cheek and as she stood talking
to her hostess calmly smoothed it in. Minga's
eyes, wide open, cool as purple morning-glories, surveyed
them. She stood, a trim, insignificant little
figure of modernity, suggesting nothing, giving promise
of nothing, dreaming of nothing, but curiously
capable of anything and everything.</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia, primming her mouth, turned to the
door; she paused with the immemorial formula of the
hostess,</p>

<p>"Dinner is announced at a quarter of seven, dear;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
will you let us know if you want anything?" Irresolutely
she drifted away; they heard the soft pat of
her low-heeled slippers, the swish of her starched
skirt, looked at each other and smiled.</p>

<p>"Exactly the same! What?" Minga giggled.
"Does she still think it's awful to say 'Darn'?" Then,
conscious of Sard's restraint, "Well, she's a sweet old
sport. I'd like to take her up in an airplane. Now,"
apologetically, "you know very well I think she's a
perfect dearrrrrr, so sort of picturesque and everything&mdash;where
do you keep your hairpins?"</p>

<p>It was part of the enigmatic expression of Minga
that with bobbed hair she should demand hairpins with
as anguished an intonation as a woman with long
tresses. When Sard produced the box, she deftly
pinned a pretty lock nearer to her cool deep-set eyes.
"It's this rotten high forehead of mine," she explained
to her friend now perched in the window-seat watching
her. "I'm determined I won't be high-brow if I
have to cut my head off to avoid it. Don't you
dread, somehow, becoming high-brow? It's so unpopular&mdash;the
men have always hated it, and now the women do.
Do you remember Sara Findlay at college?"</p>

<p>"Sara Findlay," they breathed the name through
gusts of laughter&mdash;"Sara Findlay; do you remember
her room, books everywhere, and her awful spectacles,
and the way she haunted the library and the solemn
look she turned on you when you asked her anything?
I remember one question we doped out, 'Sara, how
do you define the infinite?'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sara's engaged," said Sard, "married, for all I
know; did you hear about it?"</p>

<p>Minga turned a face of incredulous horror. Marriage
as she viewed it was the device of screen actresses
and various feature fans to change horizons;
when things got a little monotonous or there was a
chance of improving finance, one married. "That
high-brow wench, not a bit of pep, not a rag of style&mdash;to
who?"</p>

<p>"To whom, did you say?" said Sard mischievously.
The other girl, falling heavily upon the divan, now
buried her curly head in Sard's lap.</p>

<p>"To <i>who</i>," she repeated carelessly&mdash;"I won't say
it right; why should I? If the Prince of Wales or
Charlie Chaplin said 'to who' for a few weeks, we'd
all follow suit. Who invented grammar, anyway?"
Minga stretched herself, laughing up into her friend's
face.</p>

<p>"Ouf! Isn't this like the old times? You, the
stuck-up grammarian&mdash;me, the gypsy vagabond.
Woof, what an awful thing it must be to be 'the
Judge's daughter' in a little place like 'Willows-on-the-Hudson'."</p>

<p>Sard laughed a little; her face grew grave. "It's
lots of troublous things to be the Judge's daughter,
I know that," then swiftly, as if something occurred
to her, "Minga, will you do something for me?"</p>

<p>"Yep," yawned the recumbent Minga; "all right;
anything that doesn't interfere with my present position.
Sard, do you think my nails are nicer this
year?" she held up a very delicately tinted row of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
little curved shelly fingers. "In spite of golf," said
Minga, "I think that's a sweet attractive little hand,
don't you?" The fact that Sard had asked her to
do something seemed to her unimportant, and she
went on&mdash;"Notice anything?" She waved a very
pretty ring on the slender finger.</p>

<p>"Minga&mdash;you're not," now it was Sard who was
really breathless, her brown eyes shimmered with
light.</p>

<p>"Engaged, darrrrrling," drawled Minga. "Yep, to
the most idiotic little Willy you can imagine. A perfect
lady, Tawny Troop, you know Troop, the big
moving-picture man? We're all crazy about Tawny,
he's such a fool&mdash;and dance&mdash;he dances like a bubble
on the fountain. Papa Troop is worth oodles, so they
say. Mother, the Persian, doesn't know it&mdash;yet; Father,
the Mede&mdash;well, I guess we'd better postpone
that!"</p>

<p>Something careless and contemptuous in Minga's
voice kept Sard from asking any of the questions that
flew to her lips. She caught the little hand and examined
the ring. "Why, it's exquisite," she breathed.
"These are brown diamonds, aren't they, and pearls?
Oh!" The fairy beauty of the thing moved her.</p>

<p>"You see, Ducky, another girl picked it out&mdash;my
predecessor." Minga threw out the word with a curiously
mature drawl. She yawned, raised up her head,
reached out for a handglass and examined her pretty
teeth in the mirror. Suddenly she rose, her figure,
slender and reedy, bent backward and did a few
striding, strutting steps of a modern dance, humming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the while with curious catlike nasal tremolo a popular
air.</p>

<p>"Do you know this step&mdash;to the Paradise whistle
and ukulele and that new instrument, the Shiverskin,
it's just great." Around the room strode Minga,
solemnly expounding the simple steps. "You like
my ring," hummed Minga, "well, Tawny's first girl
picked it out. I saw it on her aristocratic hand and I
had to have it; also, you see, I needed Tawny to dance
with&mdash;he goes my gait&mdash;she hated to let him go; Sard,
that girl is a Moth, she eats men, eats 'em alive, but
I snitched this one," Minga giggled. "Tawny's coming
out for your first spring dance at the Club while
I'm here, but it's not announced," warned Minga,
"so don't talk bassinets."</p>

<p>It was the old Minga, only, Sard could not keep
herself from admitting this; more so, and well, there
really need not have been any more of the original
Minga. Sard, who was exactly a year older than her
friend, felt somehow centuries older. Also she had
to confess again as she had confessed to herself before,
there was something in Minga that both shamed
and hurt, while it fascinated. However, with all the
hunger of a lonely girl for a chum, Sard readily overlooked
jarring things. She reached out and drew
Minga to her, hanging an arm over the thin little
shoulder. Minga took it all coolly. "Are you letting
yourself get fat, Sard?" she criticised. Then added
caressingly, "Poor solemn Sard, we've got to whoop
things up for you now I'm here. What? I mean it!
Can't we run up a few men and some jazz and stuff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
on the telephone for to-night? Would Judgie and
Aunt Reely care? Who does your jazz this year?
We've got an angel band home, three cornets, a paradise
whistle and a drum, it's divine&mdash;well? Wait till
I get hold of that old Dunce," said Minga, "I'll choke
all the news out of him. My hat&mdash;there comes your
father's car around the drive, and I haven't got on
evening duds! What do you wear for night-eats?
Will Judgie care if I go down as I am?"</p>

<p>This was Sard's chance. She kept her arm around
the restless, pacing little figure. "Minga, will you do
something for me? Put on your prettiest dress, that
rose-colored one, talk music to Father, let him play
his new records for you." Minga made a face, but
Sard was insistent. "Get him to tell you about Terence
O'Brien&mdash;only don't you start the subject, Minga&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and
ask him if he is pleased with the
new man on the place."</p>

<p>Then Sard, at a loss just how to drill her impulsive
guest, stared at Minga thoughtfully, frowning. "No,
don't ask him that," she said. "I've changed my mind,
don't ask him that."</p>

<p>Then said Minga, "I'm to ask him about Terence
O'Brien without his knowing it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, his sister works here."</p>

<p>"Terence O'Brien," repeated Minga, "who&mdash;oh,
yes, that fellow that killed the old man, ran away with
the money, did it all just like a movie&mdash;awfully exciting!
My gracious!" Minga was awed.</p>

<p>Sard nodded. "Hush, his sister is our waitress,
and she&mdash;oh, it's pretty dreadful to see her. Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
thinks he's just a criminal, but don't you see, Minga,
he's only a boy, only eighteen."</p>

<p>Minga looked very cold and decided. The two
spots of color stood out high on her little sobered
face.</p>

<p>"But a murderer," said she solemnly. "He must
pay the penalty." Minga pronounced the word
"peenulty," but her dignity was superb. She was very
sure about justice as she was very sure about patriotism.
If you did wrong you must not be found out,
if you cared for your country you must say so very
loudly with strong dramatic effects; the idea of caring
for one's country to the extent of having a better
kind of women and men live in it had not occurred
to Minga. It does not occur to the men and women
Mingas of this world. But they are very sure
of their "patriotism." They have quite a little
patriotic strut and they imagine patriotism to consist in
a long hate of some other nation. And that it is
based forever and ever on the machinery of killing.</p>

<p>"Minga," said Sard passionately, "do you and I
always do right? Isn't it our ease and good fortune
that keep continually pulling us back from very wrong
things? How about that time on the bacon-bat up
at Divens Lake when we stole the firewood and the
corn, did we pay any fines&mdash;did the county follow us
up? Just a private letter to the faculty and old Pressy
and the Dean talking to us and that was all&mdash;yet,"
Sard looked thoughtfully out of the window, "that
was crime, stealing and trespassing, but we are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
pampered and petted and taken care of that we&mdash;well,
we don't need to murder."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't we need to murder? Well, I can tell
you, Sard Bogart, that I need to murder Marjorie
Atboon every time I look at her." Minga's face was
injured. "Her father gave her a new car if she'd
stop smoking. Well, Marjorie has the car." Minga
paused and remarked drily, "Her bedroom smells
queerly&mdash;she says she likes lots of air, she burns a
good deal of incense, but you ought to see the car,
lovely long thing, eight-cylinder, blue, cooooooooly&mdash;oilllly&mdash;olly.
Oh! how a good machine turns your
dark little world to white velvet!"</p>

<p>Sard giggled. "Minga, you always make me
laugh," she protested, "when I'm most in earnest
you're crazy and dreadful, but you're an everlasting
dear."</p>

<p>Minga whirled them both about the pretty cretonned
room.</p>

<p>"You know you love it," she chanted, "you know
you love it, you've been having too much Aunt
Aurelley." Minga putting her arms akimbo swayed
neatly pumped feet back and forth. "Did you see
Auntie stare at my rouge?" she whispered. "She
knows the worst now, doesn't she, Sard? She knows
I know there ain't no Santa Claus." With a burst of
laughter, Minga released her friend. "Wait till I
get a bath." She ripped off her little frilled blouse,
her short skirt fell to the floor. Minga stood a pretty
figure in dark knickers and white chemise. "For the
tub!" she chanted, and dove into the bathroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Amid the gushing of the faucet, Sard saw the little
figure stripped and dancing in the white porcelain
bath.</p>

<p>"Stop in on your way to the dining-car," called
Minga.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class="center">THE ORGAN BUILDER'S HOUSE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hudson River has not only the opulence that
Washington Irving portrayed, not only the swelling
of soft hills and majesty of toppling mountains and
slopes that spell fecundity of farmland but it has,
along palisade and headland, another opulence. Under
those mountains that throw down thunder-storms,
and along the rocky walls climbed by winding roads
magnificent homes testify to the imperialism that has
not yet been cleansed from the heart of man. The
instinct for choosing imposing sites for impressive
homes would be difficult to trace to its beginning.
Robber barons built their castles inaccessibly for very
good reasons; the prelates' palaces were on the hills
that all might see and be reminded of Mother Church.
The Roman Roads, unlike the furtive sunken roads
of the cavemen, were built high because of fearlessness
and pride. But the American who builds his
home, or one of his homes, on the Hudson does not
do so just because he longs to feast his eyes on
sumptuous natural terrace and broad natural waterway;
he does so because in his instinctive choice of
surroundings, he selects an expressive background for
his own dignity and his own importance.</p>

<p>All night long the great steamers of the Hudson
River glide majestically up and down, the long white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
fingers of their search-lights pointing to this and that
lordly residence. The Oil King, the Copper King,
the Pill King, and the Shoe King, whose white palaces
and miles of stocked and fruited domain are
gated and avenued away from the public, are silently
indicated to such humble travelers as care to look.
One can hardly travel the Hudson River nowadays
and worship the great Creator, for the great Creator
is a little overshadowed by the aforesaid King of
Commerce, the great Producer. But in spite of the
sleepiness and lethargic atmosphere that the Dutch
traditions have strangely imparted to the strings of
villages, there are in certain moods superb freedoms
and freshnesses along the Hudson. There are still
spiritual emphasis and quests along red sandstone
shores, where the green hemlocks gather. The sunrises
in the Westchester Hills are like black tents with
banners streaming. The waters of the Tappan Zee
are then a great glittering field of cloth of gold, and
at sunset when the houses on the Irvington Hills are
all ablaze with sunstruck window glass, the bold, black
breasts of Palisades and Hook Mountain front the
river like African slaves guarding some inner mystery
of valley, some clean, unspoiled fastness of forest and
field and stream.</p>

<p>To a man who sat at his table in a bleak old wooden
house high up on the western range, these night and
morning scenes spelled only two things, the Human
Will, as yet absorbed only in the passions of an aggressive
aggrandizement, and the proud subservience
of nature to the little schemes of men. Nature, ly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>ing
down like a great beast of destiny, to let the little
shapes and enterprises swarm and crowd over her!
"Only," thought Watts Shipman, "only when the
great beast starts to rise and take new positions, look
out then, little shapes. Either you will be raised on
some great mountain of Nature's mysterious changes
or you will slip into some new uncharted sea or who
knows, you may spill altogether out of the
world!"</p>

<p>It was this wistful attitude toward nature, the great
mystery, the great Book of Worship and Wonder that
had taken Watts Shipman from his clubs and cliques
and corporations, away from success and "putting it
over" and their accompanying shiftiness and meanness,
and had taken him for the season of a summer
into the country, to think.</p>

<p>Yes, just that&mdash;"to think," was what he replied to
complaining letters and telegrams&mdash;"Watts, what are
you doing, stuck up there on the rim of nowhere?"
His confrères laughed at the curt answer "Thinking."
For a lawyer so able, so successful, there could be no
comment of "queer" or "crazy"; Watts' partners
shrugged their shoulders and went on with the business
which, as he had denied them telephone access,
they had sometimes to refer to him by long night
letters. "Drat your thinking," writes the senior partner,
"don't I think?" To which came the teasing
telegram by code, "You don't think, you calculate."</p>

<p>Watts' house, planted high on the spur of the mountain
a few miles above Willow Roads, the little Dutch
village where Sard lived, had been owned by an or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>gan
builder about whom the Willow Roaders liked
to say "nobody knew anything." The Willow
Roaders, complacent in the usual village life where
everyone thinks he knows "everything about everyone"
disdained knowing anything about a mere organ
builder. The house, surrounded as it was by hanging
boulders and pine trees, looked gravely down on the
big field of river and on all the little steeples and
turrets and gingerbread conservativeness of Willow
Roads. Watts liked to commune with the spirit of
the man who had once lived here.</p>

<p>"I'll bet he stole some notes out of the Dawn," the
man thought, "and think of nights here&mdash;like last
evening, with the hermit thrush and the sky gold
through the trees. 'The Organ Builder'&mdash;I can just
see him, a seedy chap, possibly with too many children,
probably half starving, working up here with the
village below curious and gossiping, thinking maybe
an organ builder was immoral."</p>

<p>It was a soft yet cool spring night. The little
frogs in mountain rain pools kept up a croaking like
rusty wheels; the pungent smells of earth and leaf
mould came through the window. Fire burned quietly
and soft lamplight fell on books and rugs and flickered
over the cast of the Winged Victory, over the
dingy chimneypiece. Watts' eyes, through the smoke
of his pipe, went to this. "Nice girl," he grunted in
approval, "nice girl&mdash;afraid of nothing&mdash;ready for
anything, yet somehow all woman, true to type but
not crystallized by type." The man, rising, walked up
and down the rather bare room where one or two fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
rugs caught the warm fire colors. "I can say this for
the Greeks, they, themselves, fastened nothing upon
civilization but healthy ideals for men and women;
harvest making, home keeping, child bearing, strong
bodies, imaginative minds, it wasn't until their
æsthetics and the Roman plutocrats got hold of all
they gave the world that their philosophies were debased."
The lawyer's eyes, sombre in strength and
depth, looked fixedly at the gracious woman figure;
he compared it with the figures on Fifth Avenue,
tripping in affected coquettishness or striding in
callous mannishness. "Not clever of you, ladies, to
find no middle path," he considered. "Who made
you as you are to-day, Paris&mdash;the war? That's what
you and the newspapers and magazines say, but come
now, didn't you make yourselves? You wanted to be
'popular,' you want to be 'in' things, behold the
result." Watts' mouth curled with slow mockery on
his pipe.</p>

<p>"The Winged Victory didn't want to be popular,"
he decided. "She didn't want to be in things.</p>

<p>"She wanted to live. Who fastened the modern
woman on us, anyway?" Watts demanded sternly of
his dog. "Why have we got to stand for her?" The
silken-haired, electric-muscled beast came over to him
softly. Friar Tuck, with tail tossing, laid a devoted
head on the brown golf-trousered knee. Watts
tousled the long ears. "Always the henchman, aren't
you, you old brute&mdash;why do you play that game?"
The lawyer looked long and questioningly into his
dog's eyes. "Why don't you get up and give me an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
order; how do you know I'm superior to you? You
are probably equal to me."</p>

<p>He considered the bowl of his pipe then rubbed
it on Friar Tuck's head.</p>

<p>"Just as I suppose, if men only knew it, they could
be equal to Christ and the angels. Say, look here."
Watts lifted the dog by his forefeet. He put the two
forepaws against his breast. "How do you know I'm
superior to you? Why do you play this game&mdash;do you
just want to be 'popular' with me?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not to accept dogma&mdash;to be ready for the new
light, to trim one's mental sails for the breeze from
a fresh quarter, it had given the great criminal lawyer
a profound insight into the human heart, an almost
awful power over the souls of men. Wastrel after
wastrel had tried to look Watts Shipman in the eye,
and had known that some strange God of Equity sat
watchful in this man&mdash;that only in proportion to their
actual guilt would they be dealt with. Men and
women had broken down and told him all, only because
of the unendurable patience and remorseless
gravity of his uncondemning gaze. He had fathered
many a boy and stood many a woman on her own feet,
and yet Life, the Great Mother, had held back from
him what he, as human, knew must be the ultimate
and only gift. Women had angled for Watts Shipman
because of his fame; they had tried to use him
politically; they had trusted him, feared him and been
penitent before him. No woman had ever loved him.</p>

<p>Staring at the Victory, the man smoked silently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Half ruefully he passed his hand over the russet head
on his knee, he threw back his own great black-haired
head with its dapple of white spots; he stretched his
long limbs and his deep-lined humorous face saddened.
"Women want to play," he said softly, "uncertain,
funny little things, they want to play"&mdash;tenderly,
"and, not necessarily, to play fair&mdash;and I'm
no plaything, although," he waved his pipe toward
the bas-relief over the fire piece, "I could play with
you, Miss Victory."</p>

<p>The word play made him think of something; pushing
away the dog, Watts rose and went to a table
drawer, taking out, with a smile, a little envelope
with "Pudge" scrawled on it. The lawyer, still smiling,
slid out the contents, two Indian arrow-heads, one
white, the other gray flint. Thoughtfully he turned
them over in his large palm. "Poor good little Indians,"
he murmured, "we're still teaching our children
that you were devils, aren't we? Aren't we
funny? We rather owe you an apology, you strange,
mysterious men who never knew fulfilment&mdash;who
ranged these Hudson River shores and thronged New
Jersey and New England and were mighty hunters
and happy until you came up against the white man
and gunpowder and tobacco and whiskey! Well"&mdash;Watts
chuckled, "Pudgy shan't be prejudiced. I'll
write you a good character for him."</p>

<p>Knocking his pipe out, laying it tenderly on the
mantel, the big man sprawled like a schoolboy over
the table writing in long hand the letter that was to
accompany the arrow-heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear Pudge&mdash;How are you? What are you doing,
helping Mother or raising the roof with noise and
destruction. How are the guinea pigs? I often think
of them. Well, Pudge, I rather hope you are helping
Mother a lot, because she's such a good friend of
yours and mine and she looks so pretty and seems so
wise, though perhaps you and I are sometimes wiser.
I'm sending you two arrow-heads I found in a field
up North in Rockland County. I was fishing up near
the Ramapo Mountains where the stone walls run
like great serpents up and down the hills. There's a
lot of history lying around loose near here, Major
André and Washington and the Dutch and the Indians.
I'll show you these places some day. The
Indians, to my way of thinking, were fine fellows.
They took long steps when they walked and knew
how to set traps and hunt and fish, and they were
for the most part real religious men. But men who
knew how to make war just to get more money, came
and took their land away from them, and then the
Indians turned naughty the way you and I do sometimes,
Pudge. My! my! how they tore around and
howled and took scalps, which were not nice to keep.
No gentleman would ever scalp a lady, it is so uncomfortable,
and yet these Indians scalped many ladies!</p>

<p>"It's a pity the Indians were bad and forgot their
manners, for if they could have remembered to be
polite and gentlemanly they could have stayed here
and they would have been the real Americans and
you and I would have probably tried to imitate them
and never used anything but wampum, which means
shells; same as money to buy ice-cream cones with.
I think it would have been a heap more sensible if the
white man had made lasting friends of the Indians
and learned a lot of things that the Indians knew but
which the white men have since been too stupid to
learn. But you see, the white men had a new machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
called a 'gun,' and there was nothing to do with it
but shoot it at somebody, and that made trouble.
And the Indians, eager to learn, got guns too, and
thought it was funny to point them at people. And
their guns went off all right and there was the dickens
to pay. Machines are nice things, Pudgy, but the
men who make the machines must be sure to have
their minds go ahead of the machines, or some day
the machines will just get up and smash the world.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Pudgy, old chap&mdash;I wish you could
hear all the funny sounds up on this mountain. Friar
Tuck smells, besides hearing; he reads the night with
his nose, the same way we would read a book&mdash;and
he smells out such stories! Here are the arrow-heads;
I'm sending them to you as if you were my own little
boy, for see, Pudge&mdash;big man as I am, I have no little
boy of my own&mdash;and that sometimes happens to big
men ..."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Suddenly the man's head dropped. The pen rolled
to the floor, and Friar Tuck nosed at it a moment then
tucked his head into his folded paws. Watts Shipman
sat at the table, his own face buried in his arms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class="center">TRAITS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first evening at the Bogarts' was a trying one
for Minga. Her life, the restless, high-strung, half-bred
and wholly careless life of her age, had kept her
taut as a little bowstring for sensation. It was a
life formed, not so much on its own desires, as on
highly colored superficial presentments in the moving
pictures and theatre posters, also on those remarkably
insinuating sheets, the "Society" Fashion Magazines,
where the cut of one's coat and the number of one's
pockets are prophesied between photographs of the
important Mrs. So-and-So, or the gossiping and not
too scrupulous Madame X.</p>

<p>The rather uninspired family dinner ended amid
the soft perfunctory observances of Miss Aurelia,
punctuating the indifferent curt ejaculations of the
young people and the moody silence of the Judge;
then Minga took a hand. She sat at the table humming
a little air. "Know that?" she inquired of
Dunstan; "that's 'Don't take off another thing, Polly,
my dear.' Piggy Purse-proud sings it in 'The Other
Pair of Stockings.'"</p>

<p>These statements were received in silence. Sard
and Dunstan, mindful of the Judge's preferences in
dinner conversation, looked askance at each other, but
Minga glanced brightly around the table. To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
young person there were no inhibitions, no reserves;
above all, she was no respecter of persons. A man
who had just completed a new up-to-date garage or
aeroplane would win her casual interest, but a mere
upholder of the laws of the country seemed to her
hardly to have outline. Curiously enough, however,
her insouciance and matter-of-fact pertness sometimes
reached to that buried stream of human sensation that
underlay the granite of Bogart's surface. As he
looked at the little figure, now rising from the table,
he noted the color of her dress and spoke of it.</p>

<p>"Let me see, that's rose color, isn't it?" remarked
the Judge, stiffly. His wrinkled square-nailed hand
was on the back of the chair, and his eyes, gooseberry
and hard, yet had the sort of deference a man gives
some charming face and figure that refreshes him.
Minga's head, bent back, looked coolly up into his
face.</p>

<p>"That color, Judgie"&mdash;it was her absurd intimate
title for him&mdash;"that color is called 'Sauce Box.'"</p>

<p>"Well named." The Judge had for a second a glint
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" asked Minga. She turned her bobbed
head with the lively shake of a young animal and
asked suavely: "Now what, for instance, is the name
of the cloth of your coat?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" ... Dunstan, prowling about, looking
for cigarettes, upset a pile of books and arrested
a plundering hand. He winked at Sard over Minga's
unconscious head, saying meanwhile plaintively,
"Why can't I find any matches? This family sinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
lower every day!" Dunstan watched to see how his
father was taking Minga's innocent question.</p>

<p>"What kind of cloth does a Chief Justice wear,
anyhow; something impenetrable, I suppose, calculated
to endure, impervious to shouts and howls and
woman's tears," he ventured.</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia, waving the maid with the coffee service
out on the western veranda, looked at her nephew
approvingly. "That's a very interesting idea of
yours, Dunstan." The timid lady, intent on keeping
the conversation in a calm backwater, went on to
supply that as nearly as she could remember there
was no mention of "the cloth" judicially, but only for
the clergy, and when one thought of it, went on the
rising muffled voice, serenely unconscious&mdash;"The
coats of the clergy were blacker and smoother and&mdash;er&mdash;more
dignified than anyone's else&mdash;I've often been
struck by it at weddings&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;funerals," said
Miss Aurelia.</p>

<p>"I shall look for it at the next&mdash;er&mdash;execution,"
said Dunstan as he rolled his eyes at Minga.</p>

<p>"Now Bishop Cravanette while dining here wore a
velvet Oxford coat, I remember," Miss Aurelia
thrilled to her topic, "he dined here&mdash;it was at the
time of the laying of the corner-stone of the&mdash;er&mdash;church&mdash;they&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dunstan, winding a long arm around Sard's neck,
another around Minga's shoulders, reeled the two
girls out of the room. "She's off, Bishop Cravanette!"
he murmured. "That means the rest of the
evening; all on your account, Minga, unless some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>body
chokes her. Bishop Cravanette," Dunstan's
mouth modeled on Miss Aurelia's pursy one, too full
of its white teeth. "Seems to me the most ideal man
for his&mdash;er&mdash;very high calling. His wife less so.
The qualifications of a bishop's wife should be&mdash;er&mdash;she&mdash;he,
I remember they&mdash;er&mdash;I had an aunt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sard put her hand over his mouth, but the boy
murmured through his sister's punishing fingers,
"Minga, get Aunt Reely to tell the story of Sard's
name to-night. Then that will be over!"</p>

<p>Sard took his cigarette case out of his pocket.
"That will do for you," she lovingly tweaked his ear;
"now light up, put up, shut up; you're getting
facetious at your own vulgarity, as Father says."</p>

<p>But Dunstan, imitating Miss Aurelia's fussy ways,
was dusting off his chair preparatory to sitting down.
In spite of his long, awkward, muscular form this
imitation of soft settling and sighing was ludicrously
exact. Dora, bringing in the coffee tray, put an end
to it, however, and the Judge and Miss Reely joined
the young people. Sard rose till her aunt and father
were seated, but Minga and Dunstan coolly sat, the
former smoking until the waitress disappeared. Then
Minga, behind her curved hand, grew confidential.
She leaned toward Judge Bogart like a woman of the
world.</p>

<p>"Tell me about that new murderer of yours," she
begged. She had forgotten Sard's instructions "don't
you start the subject."</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia interrupted nervously. She waved
the sugar tongs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two lumps, Minga, dear?"</p>

<p>"I don't take coffee, thank you," returned Minga
imperturbably. She put her hand on the august knee
of Sard's father. "Tell me all about that murderer,
Dora's brother."</p>

<p>It was an unwritten law in the Bogarts' household
that the affairs of his judicial calling should never be
mentioned to the Judge. He took his cigar from his
mouth and slowly turned his head; the hard old eyes,
the mouth set in two gray lines under the crisply
trimmed mustache, revealed the iron rigors of the
human face set to the inexorable, for it was through
the inexorable power of decision that the Judge had
risen to his fame locally and abroad. These things
suddenly confronted with that most amazing audacity,
that marvelous magnet, the unwitting bold, clear-eyed
face of woman-youth, softened perceptibly. The two
gray lines of lip moved slightly. Minga's little pink
cheeks, curly hair, her rosy dress, the little inconsequent
hand on the Judge's knee, these things had a
flavor and power, the depth of which the girl could
not possibly guess. Yet Minga did most things very
deliberately. Now she naughtily twisted her mouth at
Sard.</p>

<p>"Ah, come on now, Judgie," turning her quizzical
head to one side. "You can't have all the fun of
jugging bad boys. After all, you only represent the
people&mdash;that's us&mdash;let us in on it!"</p>

<p>Dunstan, blowing smoke in the air, almost held his
breath. Sard, staring, put down her coffee cup. They
both saw the queer gleam come into the concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
eyes. A big hand steely with golf came down hard
on Minga's indolent little fist. "Young lady!" said
Judge Bogart, slowly and decisively, "you ought to
be spanked."</p>

<p>"Oh, brother," purred Miss Reely, "I don't think&mdash;it
doesn't seem&mdash;&mdash;" Then to Minga, "Why, I
am sure you didn't mean&mdash;why, George&mdash;I don't think
you ever said a thing like that. I feel that Minga
was only asking for information." Sard and Dunstan
quivered with silent laughter; but the Judge rose
in quick displeasure. Minga passed her hand slowly
down his sleeve. "Ah, Judgie, dear," she pouted, "I
didn't mean anything. I didn't know that judges took
the Hippocratic oath and everything." One would
have thought that there were tears of vexation and
embarrassment in the girl's voice, but she turned a
naughty stare on Dunstan. "Well, your father is a
crab, a perfect crab!" Minga's tone somehow had
nothing that could be modernly recognized as rudeness.
It was merely spoiled privilege that made her
snap her fingers decisively and look revengefully at
the retreating judicial back&mdash;perhaps Judge Bogart
felt what is true of the Mingas of this world, that
they have an amazing power of removing the solemn
humbug of prestige from its intrenchment and are
therefore dangerous. The Judge heard the petulant,
"I'll get even with you," but he did not smile or turn
the disapproving back, so the little guest turned rather
drearily to Miss Aurelia. This sort of evening for
Minga was incredibly dull; it must be enlivened in
some way. Stifling a yawn, not too cleverly, Minga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
remarked: "Dunstan says maybe you'll tell us how
Sard got her queer name."</p>

<p>Sard, herself, had followed her father into the library
to put records on his talking machine. The
Judge's favorite way of spending a spring evening
was to deny all callers and to sit by the window in
front of the square refrigerator-looking instrument
while Sard, like a slave, drew forth and deposited the
records of his choice. Through the windows of the
unlighted room showed squares of black sky with
one or two stars hanging. A young vine tapped
against the wire netting or beckoned with leaf fingers.
The Judge never looked at his daughter standing
straight and ready for his signal of approval or displeasure.
She chose the more sentimental and romantic
of airs and sometimes when they pleased him,
he softened; his eyes closed at the finale of <i>La Sonnambula</i>
or <i>Donna e Mobile</i>; he would sometimes snort,
clear his throat and say, "Very pretty, very pretty."
Sard would smile a little, looking rather wistfully at
him. Perhaps when her father heard this music he
wandered down the paths of youth, paths of wistfulness
and wanting to do right, paths such as hers must
be: what had been his laws? What had at last made
him this curt, severe, unapproachable man? "What
were your laws, Father?" the girl almost whispered.
"Did you always live under the law?"</p>

<p>"Very pretty&mdash;very pretty," snapped the Judge.
"The best machines are accurate, that's the idea,
accurate; no banging, tinpanning; accuracy, that's
the test of music."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl, gravely obedient to him, listened to those
comments. At college Sard had heard all the New
Testament in modern music, the superb ranges, the
exquisite far countries of sound and rhythm. For
her the Russian compositions had spelled the awful
darkness of a dark land, through which in splendid
bursts came the hope of full golden wheat fields, the
piteous tragic faces of a people longing to rise and
walk from the shackles of years into their own souls'
birthright. The Spanish gravity and witchery as of
dancing lights in the mountains, the French stringing
of water pearls and culling of moonlit flowers; the exquisite
question of modern unresolved chords, or the
striding rhythms and deep chests of the masculine
Bach fugues. Frolicking rural joy of the old gigues
and morrices and the sombre human pathos of old
folk songs&mdash;the girl harking back over those rich immemorial
afternoons and evenings of the music at
college, wondered at herself, putting on the records,
setting the needles, half shrinking from the automatic
preliminary whir. "The heart bowed down with
weight of woe," she looked at the grizzled head of
the man whose name she bore. Was his heart "bowed
down with weight of woe," was there some sore spot
in his heart where, if she might win, she might see
him as he was in the old days of youth and his love;
had he ever agonized, cared about the tragic injustices
of life? Or, did he just coddle a sense of
personal loss and woe?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">We love Foddie, don't we, little Sard, we
aren't afraid of him? He won't put us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
prison</span>," the curious little sweet-smelling whispers
came back to Sard; she felt the soft touch of curls on
her face, all the flummery and subtle trappings of the
lacy little mother. These people were Sard's parents
and yet they were lost to her, as remote as if they had
both died! Over and over the longing had come to
Sard to put her arms around her father's neck and
say, "Are you thinking of her too&mdash;these days?"
but she could as soon have put her arms around the
kitchen chimney.</p>

<p>On the east veranda as the moon rose the soft voice
of Miss Aurelia was placidly relating:</p>

<p>"Yes, Sard's name is strange. Her father, however,
has allowed her to keep it&mdash;we&mdash;your mother,
Dunstan&mdash;they, well, it was thought that your father
preferred a boy, but afterward you&mdash;er&mdash;came,
Dunstan, and that, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," drawled Minga. "You&mdash;er&mdash;came,
Dunstan." The girl was delicately smoking, enjoying
Miss Aurelia's horror and considering the
diamond on her engagement finger. It flickered in
the moonlight like a wicked eye. Miss Aurelia somewhat
stiffly continued:</p>

<p>"Sardonyx was your mother's favorite stone&mdash;she&mdash;er&mdash;wore
the Sardonyx signet ring of an ancestor."</p>

<p>"By Jove! you don't say," ejaculated Dunstan.
He stuck his heels higher on the rail and struck a
match; he leaned over the terrace to flick some ashes
into a jardinière. "And so I suppose&mdash;at that time&mdash;because
of that&mdash;she&mdash;he&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop it, you demon, stop it," murmured Minga;
"you'll spoil the whole thing; it's wonderful, it's like
knitting, knit two, purl two, turn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So that Mrs. Bogart," recommenced Miss Aurelia
with dignity, but being plunged into the enormous
detail of her story, she floundered, helpless. "So
that after little Sard, the&mdash;er&mdash;baby, you know&mdash;er&mdash;came&mdash;Mrs.
Bogart believing&mdash;that is&mdash;or rather
having been told&mdash;er&mdash;no&mdash;well, having expected a
boy&mdash;got the idea of not being able to choose an appropriate
name for a girl&mdash;and in consequence&mdash;afterward
you understand."</p>

<p>Dunstan and Minga helpfully nodded&mdash;"afterward"
they prompted!</p>

<p>"That is, when Sard was three days old, Mrs.
Bogart suddenly said, that is, I have always understood
that she said it suddenly&mdash;my brother would
know accurately&mdash;she said, 'She's to be called Sardonyx'&mdash;'Sardonyx'
like that."</p>

<p>"Really," drawled Minga.</p>

<p>"But Sardonyx was&mdash;er&mdash;quite masculine, as you
see," continued Miss Aurelia with zest; the narrator
turned her face somewhat eagerly and the pursy
mouth, too full of teeth, continued: "This feminization
of it was Mrs. Bogart's own&mdash;quite original, we
thought. She made it Sardonice, very clever, everyone
said&mdash;there was no opposition. I remember,"
added Miss Aurelia, "that at that time, for certain
reasons, they were anxious not to have the&mdash;er&mdash;brain&mdash;too
active&mdash;and we&mdash;er&mdash;tried in every way to distract
her thought&mdash;but that is how Sard got her name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
'Sardonice'&mdash;most unusual," concluded Miss Aurelia
a trifle apologetically.</p>

<p>"Why, she could have been named Jezebel, under
the circumstances," remarked Dunstan. "But&mdash;er&mdash;as
it is&mdash;we&mdash;er&mdash;call her 'Sardine' for short." The
lad, lazily smoking, rolled one eye 'round on Minga.</p>

<p>"Dunstan&mdash;&mdash;" reproved Miss Aurelia.</p>

<p>"Really?" Minga drawled the easy little word
again, then with some recollection of the archaic thing
called "manners," "Thanks ever so much, Miss
Aurelia&mdash;I'm sure it was awfully clever of Mrs. Bogart;
I always wondered how Sard got her name.
Wouldn't it be fun to have a lot of girls with names
like that&mdash;Emerald, Diamond, Sapphire, Jade&mdash;I
could have been the Jade," remarked Minga with a
demure chuckle.</p>

<p>"You've got your wish," observed Dunstan with
emphasis. "A little red Jade, what?" He finished
his cigarette, lingeringly pinned down the butt, extinguished
it, then rose, stretching. "Well," with a
look of sweet seriousness, "I'm off to have a whack
at those old conditions."</p>

<p>"You mean you're off to bed because you're bored,"
said Minga scornfully. "You mean you're going to
work out poker hands."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Polly Prunella," the lad bent over and
kissed the top fluff of curls. The girl reached out a
punishing hand and he drew back, chuckling. "You
used to let me last year," he explained.</p>

<p>"Say," Minga demanded, boyishly, "what do you
think I am? You do that again and see what will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
happen." "Bing" with a heavy slap, the little rose-frocked
figure pushed him backward. "My jiu jitsu,"
explained Minga modestly to the horrified Miss
Aurelia. "I took Self-Defense all last year&mdash;I could
tackle any New York gunman with that special undercut."</p>

<p>"Dunstan!" said Miss Aurelia, severely, to her
nephew&mdash;"how ungentlemanly. Never&mdash;never let me
see you do such a thing again."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Dunstan, penitently. He was looking
at Minga with liking, friendly boyish eyes. "I
shan't want to do it again, not just there. Hey, Minga,
I'll kiss you better next time, what?"</p>

<p>"Go to bed, you big Swede," retorted that lady,
but the little figure in rose-color now leaned over and
patted Miss Aurelia's hand. "Do I seem awful?"
she asked anxiously. "Mother says I do; I don't
want you to dislike me&mdash;you don't like my smoking?
The Persian hates it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," breathed kind Miss Aurelia, "I
dislike you? But aren't the girls nowadays very
lacking in manners, smoking and all?"</p>

<p>Minga consoled her. "We have to act like this
nowadays, you know; that's why we don't need chaperones
but, of course, there is a good deal of rough
stuff if a boy doesn't know you're nice, and of course
some girls aren't. Now you take any stag line at any
dance; sometimes the fellows get silly and, well, they
drink sometimes and, believe me, that needs some
handling." Minga, head down, considered her slippers
gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Aurelia stared...."The&mdash;er&mdash;stag
line&mdash;why, Sard never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well," Minga leaned her head back against
the wall, her little feet beating time to the music
within, "Sard doesn't go in so much for that kind of
thing, all the boys really want to dance with her and
she knows it and doesn't hit it up and she won't allow
cut-ins and that kind of thing&mdash;but most of us like
the excitement, the being grabbed, you know, and so
the boys like to show each other what cavemen they
are, and, well, they do get silly and rough-house and
you have to handle them like a mother&mdash;I've grown
old," said Minga, in a burst of confidence, "I've
grown old just keeping some of these lads where they
belong." The girl rose and pecked at Miss Aurelia's
sagging cheek. "Isn't your hair lovely," she observed,
"and what pretty feet you've got. Why don't
you get married?"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;dear"&mdash;Miss Aurelia kept hold of the little
brown hand and gasped, her eyes were wide with
astonishment&mdash;"at&mdash;er&mdash;my age?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Minga with conviction&mdash;"you're
feminine and all that, you know&mdash;a lot of men stand
for that still&mdash;take some old blasé clubman and stuff
him into a husband."</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia, stunned, let go of the hand; she was
as one paralyzed.</p>

<p>"Nighty night," said Minga lightly. "Do you care
if I steal an orange? I shan't say good-night to
Judgie, I've committed him to bread and water for
three days." The girl laughed. "What's that thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
they're playing?" She hesitated, nodding her head toward
the music-room.</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia thought it must be Dvorak's "New
World. The Largo...."</p>

<p>Minga, curly head to one side, listened a moment,
then she shivered. "A little too weird and woozy
for me," she announced. "I hate Sard's taste in
music; I want everything calcium-colored&mdash;Fizz,"
said Minga explanatorily, "and jazz and dizz!" She
stood there, a little undetermined, listening and staring
at the white moonlight on the water of the river
stretched far out below the terrace.</p>

<p>Then Minga looked solemnly at Miss Aurelia.
"Do you believe that love is divine?" she asked
casually.</p>

<p>"Why," said Miss Aurelia, "why, my dear child,
of course I do&mdash;it's&mdash;I always thought&mdash;I&mdash;we&mdash;sometimes&mdash;it
is said to be."</p>

<p>But Minga, with a queer little self-conscious laugh,
broke away from the gentle detaining hand. She
walked up-stairs, whistling; as she passed Dunstan's
door, she gave it a decided thump.</p>

<p>Later Sard slowly climbed the stairs to the tower
room. The moonlight shone in patches and blocks of
shimmering glamor on the floor and across the white
bed. The girl stood looking out. She stared
strangely with a look of concealed curiosity out to the
seat under the enormous shadow of the great flowering
horse-chestnut outside of the room where the
music had been. All that evening Sard, soberly putting
on records, had been conscious of a tall gaun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>t
figure sitting on the rustic seat under the horse-chestnut,
its head buried in its arms. Now the seat was
empty, but Sard could see a man standing out on the
lawn amid a ring of Norway spruce spreading on the
sky. It was Colter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class="center">WHOOPING IT UP</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> these days expressed itself in a ring of automobiles
around the drive of Sard's home. Minga's
coming stimulated the activities of a certain set known
as the "Bunch," and the various hulking sedans or
little roadsters lurching in the gutters were like so
many beads on the rosary of her "popularity." In
the village the prestige of the maidens was read by
these signs. "Peggy Martin can't be very popular.
I never see but one car in front of her house." "The
Fairs must be very dull people. One never sees any
parking on their driveway."</p>

<p>These machines, groomed and glossy, or in some
cases dilapidated and frankly dirty, driven by a youth
never contented to stay long in one place, had their
own individual swan-songs and Iliads, their maladies,
their insides, their prowess in speed and climbing, and
furnished food for much of the conversation of
Minga's associates. A tall, red-headed lad would inquire
of his feminine neighbor, lolling in the canvas
hammocks on the Judge's terrace of an evening, "Did
you see her buck coming over the hill? The old maid!
Didn't want to do the stunt on first, so I kicked her
into second and she climbed it, the old girl, spitting
and blowing. Well, I thought the cranky thing would
bust a valve or something."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Then would follow serious dissertation on spark
plugs and gas tanks, the new fuels, graded lubricating
oils and service fuses.</p>

<p>"Where do you garage now, Dave?" inquired one
tan-shirted hedonist.</p>

<p>"Oh, I garage on the front lawn," replied the careless
Dave. "Mother hates it, says it spoils the grass,
you know, but why bother about grass? Grass isn't
fashionable any more&mdash;out of date, I tell her, to have
grass and flowers and things. Cut all that out, I say,
old stuff!"</p>

<p>Another youth, dapper, with the long-boned face
of the manipulator of social things, deftly drew attention
to his own brand new roadster. "Got Mother
to jog the old gentleman some. Went out and played
golf with him a couple of times. Result!" With
negligent cigarette he indicated the graceful powerful
shape. "Like that color? Not too loud, what?"
The youth appealed to the girls sitting on the stone
coping that swept the river-ward side of the house.
"I don't want 'em to think I'm Mary Pickford or
anything," was his modest suggestion.</p>

<p>The girls, swinging their feet encased in the flat,
practical tennis shoes of the period, looked their usual
momentary cold interest. Their heads, impertinently
bobbed, or spectacularly "bunned," had abundant
hair that covered bright enough little brains, but their
mouths, trained into machine talk, dealt machine-like
with little well-worn screws and cogs and belts of
words, so that what they turned out was machine like;
not related thought or challenging conversation, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
trite sentences and inferences and ejaculations that
made small circles of thought.</p>

<p>Gertrude, the leader of the village girls, smiled
dreamily at the car in question. "It's a good make,
isn't it?" she said, then&mdash;"That firm's worth millions
of dollars, they say, even in these after-the-war
days." Minga nodded authoritatively, as one who
knew. They all looked at her respectfully.</p>

<p>"The Mede says that to drive that car is to drive
molten gold," said Minga&mdash;it was understood that
Minga spoke of her father as the Mede. No one knew
exactly what the allusion meant, but it showed somehow
that Minga was no slave to parental authority
and that she "knew" history.</p>

<p>"I want Dad to get a new car instead of a new
piano," said Cynthia. "With the talking machine and
George's cornet we don't really need a piano&mdash;but I
do need a good roadster to&mdash;to get to the library and&mdash;and
church," Cynthia inclined her head demurely.</p>

<p>"Yah&mdash;Yah!" they all jeered. "To get to the library
and church! Some getting, I'll say!"</p>

<p>Dunstan looked up. "Whew!" he whistled, "to
get to the beauty parlor, to the hashish joint, to the
ice-cream palace, to the hooch chapel."</p>

<p>"Yah!" they all laughed, Gertrude a little more
spitefully than the others. Cynthia Bradon, a lithe,
ripe blonde of sixteen, had had experiences with many
things. It was known that she had had a few "shots"
of morphine and would swallow, for a wager, many
hectic and sulphuric beverages. She had run away
and been unaccounted for for a week, she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
photographed in a bathing suit by a moving picture
man. Cynthia was not sensitive, and her beauty,
peach-like and of a glowing dewiness, seemed about
the most harmless beauty in the world, because it
covered so empty and so trivial a soul. Among the
elders, she was considered a lost character. Among
those who knew her she was known to be merely
silly, lazy and untidy.</p>

<p>Cynthia's own group accepted her without enthusiasm
or criticism. She was regarded as one who
was no obstructionist and who by sheer triviality added
much to the gayety of nations. Her "line" was silliness.
Long education by the sensational type of moving
picture had removed from these young people any
morbid sensitiveness. "Cinny," and "Cinema" as
they called her, wanted to find out about morphine&mdash;let
her. "Fancy," so named from Frances, was a
fine swimmer, always diving against her mother's command.
She had saved a child once&mdash;moral&mdash;if Fancy
hadn't disobeyed her mother she couldn't have saved
the child! Marjorie, who was fat and too evidently
made up, was a good sport and awfully nice at picnics
and sailed a boat well and was jolly and fair in all
games. Gertrude, dubbed facetiously "the road-hog,"
had nearly killed an old man by running over
him in breaking speed laws; but this fact instead of
making her in any way taboo, only served to add to
her interest as a rather tragic saturnine young person
in extremely abbreviated skirts.</p>

<p>They were all far away from the tradition and
early training of the parents who had borne them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
spent incalculable money on them, scoured the realm
for the best food for them; added to their youthful
desires, their green sloths, given them leisure and opportunity
and crammed them with diversion but
neglected to set them an unswerving example of
strong, frank, fearless, reverent and purposeful life.
The young people of to-day analyzed like a sort of
mischievous ivy or burdock burr, growing rank in the
pure garden of our purpose, have become what they
are merely by feeding on the soil around them. They
are the curious sports of a few rather shameful vines
and fruits of our own negligence.</p>

<p>When they speak flippantly of love and marriage,
they do so with a very accurate knowledge of the
percentage of divorces and the reasons for these divorces.
When they reveal all that is legally possible
of their fine young bodies, they do so after a war
which placed the highest percentage on physical superiority
and challenged the needs for privacy, and
they do so impelled by frankness and a healthy Narcissism
that is much better than our old time reticence,
our concealment of deformity and weakness, our
æsthetic half-revealing and suggesting that made so
strong a desire for full revelation.</p>

<p>It would be rather a joke to find that in these ways
youth may surpass us one day in virtue and purity.
It is quite possible that Don Juan, about whom we
whispered so much behind our hands, would make no
impression at all upon the young men and women of
Minga's group. Walt Whitman's great biologic,
physiologic roaring they would frown over, puzzled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
That one man, old, too, with a white beard, should
speak familiarly of prostitutes and be so anxious to
specify and catalogue arms and legs and thighs and
bones and blood and bone-sockets, they would think
"queer." But if one were to step out and say to a
group like that on the Judge's loggia, "Don Juan was
over-sexed. His amours were silly and maudlin because
his great creator was an embittered and sensitive
and suffering man" there would be a low understanding
comment of  "Uh, huh?&mdash;that so?" and a
general cold-blooded note-taking as to Don Juan.</p>

<p>To go on about Whitman and suggest that Walt
was a great human comrade who at a time when there
were no "legs" and no "spades" spoken of in the
world believed in men and women recognizing the
glory of sex and helping each other; believed in something
divine inside of each that works its way through,
no matter how low we sink; believed that we must
struggle and overcome, yet be honest while conquering,
sincere about life while controlled with it, that
would be to receive the casual answer, "Say, that's
some little Walt. Where did he tend bar?" But
these things would strike little fire. There would be
no real interest until one mentioned a new machine,
a scientific discovery, a sporting champion or a unique
crime. Then keen faces would be bent upon you, keen
eyes would interrogate&mdash;Facts, facts, facts! So
youth pushes by all your dreams, all your virtues, all
your sentimentalities and theories for its true meat&mdash;facts!</p>

<p>The light, the casual, the cynical, the flippant, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
pondering of rather gross realities and in the cases
of the girls a very destructive, squalid and ignorant
playing with the great laws of life as given into the
hands of men and women is the expression of America
to-day. To deplore is futile, to try to train any group
of children away from these general lines of license
and freedom, impossible. It belongs to the age; that
age is the aftermath of crazy luxury and wealth.
There is some great biologic secret behind it all, and
this biologic secret may be that such wealth, such
leisure, such exhibition, as opposed to inhibition, as
we once deemed desirable is undesirable, unendurable,
in that it affects life with a kind of sponginess, a sort
of quicksand whereon nothing may grow or be built.
It may be that such surroundings as we have tried to
give our children have made their bodies fine, but
have shrunken and vitiated their souls, that their use
of our hard-earned materialism has been to deny all
our insistence upon worth and solidity and virtue
but it bears one sure portent. To the observer of the
"Minga group" all over America to-day it is apparent
that this Youth will some day take itself in hand,
that it will create a new ethic of worth and virtue
that will bear more acute scanning than does ours.
That, though they must stop and go back to hard
things and solemn things, above all to recreate the
things they have wasted; they are preparing for some
enormous new Scheme, some great rational universalism;
they will perform that duty ultimately, with a
greater measure of understanding than our precepts
could have given them. They will be free of all tan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>gle
and rot of the Seeming, they will know! They
will go forward, keen, fearless, open-eyed, fit to help
carry on the destiny of the whole world.</p>

<p>Soon the general restlessness on the terrace communicated
itself in expression. "Where do we go
from here?" asked one chap&mdash;he rose and did a short
shuffling step, the others clapping their hands and
whistling an air which ended with the plaintive refrain:
"And the reason he didn't marry me, was his
four merry wives across the sea." Minga stepped
inside and slipped on the phonograph a record of
Honolulu Jazz and to this brassy whistling clangor
the couples clinched, and young, long, canvas-shoed,
thin legs stepped about in one of the curious walking
dances of the time. This over, they stopped and
dawdled, staring at each other. There were a few
personal sallies, one or two lazy whoops, and then the
old thirst for sensation: "Where do we go from
here?"</p>

<p>"I know," suggested the youth with the new car&mdash;"Dunce,
listen to my hunch, love me for my bright
ideas. All hike out to Lovejoy's for hot dogs and
then back to Billy's for sundaes. Come on, be a sport,
everybody, what matter if you've got no coin?
I'm cahoots with you, I'll stand the multitude. Got
me gold mine with me."</p>

<p>"I can't go," complained Dunstan moodily, "got a
quizz coming at eight-thirty, the infernal Latin
rooster. I'd like to choke him."</p>

<p>"Cut it out, cut it out!" came a chorus of stern
voices.... "Say, Dunce, what's the matter with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
yah, gettin' queer? Hey? They only put Latin in
the cirickulum to please the wives of the trustees.
Yah! cut it out, man&mdash;say, if yuh don't have any fun,
you'll go batty; the doctors all say so. Sure they do!
Everybody does go batty that's high-brow and studies
and all that drool. Say, cut it out, whoop it up if yuh
want to keep from suicide. By heck! you'll do sumpin
desperate if you keep up with this Latin, like that
feller your old man is going to put in the Can. How
about that trial; when is it coming off?"</p>

<p>"Chuck that," muttered Dunstan, a grave significant
look in the direction of the house&mdash;"Governor is inside.
Sard's coming out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sard's coming out," they chanted gibingly.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Oh, the Mermaid Lady came out, you bet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She was not fully dressed:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pretty curls of her hair were wet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I leave you to guess the rest."</span><br />
</p>

<p>This gem started by the young chap with the new
car was taken up and chanted by his associates, all
beating time and clapping in imitation of negro minstrels.
It was done by way of changing an unwelcome
subject and Sard, appearing at the door, put her
finger on her lips. "If you want to sing," she said
laughingly, "you'll have to go in swimming or something;
Father's in his den and I'm sworn to keep
things quiet."</p>

<p>"Getting up the data for the great day?" asked one
boy saucily.</p>

<p>Sard shook her head at him, but Minga giggled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
"Wouldn't it be fun to go right in now, stand in a
row in front of Judgie and say, 'We, the under-signed,
beg for the freedom of Terence O'Brien, given
into our hands,' you know the way they used to do in&mdash;in
Bret Harte and places," finished Minga a little
vaguely. "Get him out from under the law."</p>

<p>The group brightened; here was something to do,
something unusual and racy and like the movies; they
saw the drama of it.</p>

<p>"You'd have to have a writ of habeas corpus," said
one young fellow. He wore large round glasses and
looked solemn. "Who's his counsel?" he demanded
of Sard, professionally.</p>

<p>She gave the name of a village lawyer&mdash;"I'm afraid
it's only a form, though poor Dora's wages go for it,
for I&mdash;I don't believe there is much defense," Sard
bent her brows. "It's all wrong, you know; one of us
would have the best counsel money could buy; if our
own families couldn't afford it, some rich relative
would come forward to save the name."</p>

<p>"That's right, she's dead right." The young faces
ranged along the terrace wall looked solemnly on
Sard; from trifling, aimless pleasure-seekers they became
suddenly sober, filled with the sense of human
tragedy of inequality and unfairness.</p>

<p>"Well, then, come on." Minga stood on audacious
toes; she bowed like a preening butterfly. "Who'll
follow? I'll lead!"</p>

<p>Lounging to their feet they made ready to follow
her but Sard, older and steadier, restrained them.
"That's idiotic," the girl said abruptly&mdash;"you don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
know what a rage it would put Dad in, Minga!
You've never seen him when he's really angry."</p>

<p>"Does he carry on some?" asked one of the boys.</p>

<p>Sard was silent for a moment, then, "He is quite
terrible," she said quietly; "it would make things
worse in every way to go to Dad now&mdash;besides you
know as well as I do that he could officially do nothing,
but," Sard, looking at them all, spoke low, "I have
an idea, I've been thinking."</p>

<p>They always listened respectfully to Sard. She was
the stuff of which leaders are made. Indifferent to
popularity, caring only for the enterprise in which she
was engaged, cool, controlled, just as she was in card
games or swimming and tennis, now she took charge
of the group as she had done a hundred times before.</p>

<p>"There's that famous lawyer who is spending the
summer in the organ builder's house on the mountain;
you know about him."</p>

<p>"Don't I," spoke up Minga, eagerly. "He's a
great friend of my Cousin Eleanor Ledyard and her
little Pudge; he writes Pudge the funniest letters.... My!"
sighed Minga. "He's frightfully important;
he's been counsel for all the millionaires and
magnates, he has eyes like X-rays, they look you
through and through. Wow! I'm afraid of him."</p>

<p>The other girl hesitated. "He's famous and all
that," she said slowly. "Father knows him well, but
I've read things he has written in the magazines and&mdash;and&mdash;he
isn't&mdash;well, you know how things are done?"
The group, curiously enough, in spite of no reading at
all, did know how things are done. How fatally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
lies, the subsidizing, the political trickery and chicanery
persist in spite of the smug assumptions of virtues;
the falsity of the effort to push the world back
to an age where just the title of  "Christian" would
suffice instead of the more recent challenge which insists
that the Christian be like Christ. They knew,
these little sated, over-indulged, inexperienced sprouts
of materialism, somehow or other, they knew.</p>

<p>"The loss of innocence" which their elders so
much deplored has given them a cool fatal knowledge
of the rottenness hitherto hidden from them; they
know the failures and compromises upon which that
æsthetic dream of  "innocence" has been dreamed.
They will have none of it.</p>

<p>Minga chasséd to the terrace steps; she pinned a
scarf around her head turban-fashion and her eyes
shone with adventurous gleam. "Say, listen," she
said in the vernacular&mdash;"Say&mdash;listen&mdash;let's all pile
in the machines and go up there on the mountain and
stand in a row before Watts Shipman. Let's ask him
to take Terence's case; let's ask him if he could get
Terry off from a life's sentence. All of us&mdash;Yes.
What? Serve Judgie right," added Minga, indignantly,
"for not being willing to talk to me about it."</p>

<p>"Whew!" breathed a young chap in white flannels.
The youth, in large horn-rimmed spectacles, went solemnly
over to Sard and held out his hand, "I'm with
you. It will make a sensation, anyway; maybe we
couldn't get much out of Shipman but I'm with you,
only what will Papa say?"</p>

<p>Sard had been thinking about that; a curious look in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
her eyes, she faced the boy. "Father's law is one
thing," the girl said it without a trace of disrespect or
rebellion, "but mine is another and I want to be true
to mine! I don't know how you feel," she looked
soberly at the owlish one, "but I can't be happy and
know that there is so much tragedy in the world. I
can't live under that law."</p>

<p>It was the old sad cry of youth, "Must my happiness,
then, be bought at the expense of so much
human frustration and misery?" But the owlish-eyed
one repudiated this notion.</p>

<p>"You'll have to," he said oracularly&mdash;"somebody's
always hurting somebody&mdash;someone is always getting
happiness out of someone's else misery." The horn-rimmed
eyes looked very mature and bitter.</p>

<p>But several of the group jumped down from the terrace
and were now tinkering with the machines in the
drive. Jeering cries came from one to another as the
engines started up. "Minga goes with me!"
"Aw! go on, you animal, she does not; she goes with
me; right here, Minga, where there's a looking-glass
and rouge and sachet powder and everything&mdash;Sard
goes with Thorny Croft. Hey, Nonny, Nonny, the
two nuts, the two high-brows! Cinny'll catch cold;
she hasn't got enough clothes on; Cinny never has
enough clothes on. How about the dance the other
night? Well&mdash;well&mdash;well, we saw a good deal of
Cinny!" Not delicate, not pretty, not dignified, not
inspiring. But it belongs to the age, Messieur et Mesdames;
what part have you had in making the age
what it is?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class="center">THE EXPEDITION</div>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Watts</span>:</p>

<p>Pudge wants me to write and thank you for
your letter. He was fascinated with the arrow-heads
and listened with his accustomed solemnity to your
remarks about "minding mother." An hour afterward
I found him putting cold cream, which I have
expressly forbidden him to touch, all over the kitten.
Upon remonstrance he said blandly, "You didn't tell
me not to put cold cream on the kitten, Mother, and
she didn't say anything." It was all so funny and he
was so naughty afterward! It opened up strange
thoughts of all the responsibilities I shall have with
him. I wondered if when Pudge grows up the first
thing he will hear will be all the sad and ugly stories
that are told of his father and if he will believe that
they cast an irrevocable shadow on his own life. I
have known young fellows who went steadily to the
bad because their fathers were weak in some way.
They thought they were foredoomed!</p>

<p>I don't even know whether to go on letting him have
his own name, his father's name, now disgraced and
tragic, but how can I stop things? He is his father,
he has his mouth, the beautiful, fateful mouth that
always made me feel as if I were a ship, wrecked on
it, and he has his hair and his voice and his reckless
and beseeching ways. Oh, Watts, you saved my husband,
all there was to save, brought him back home;
though you couldn't save him from himself.</p>

<p>Thanks for the arrow-heads, Watts, and please write
me when you like. You seem to think I might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
care to hear. I have known why it was always Pudge
you wrote to, but I have grown a little stronger, a
little less like a wounded animal that wants to bite the
hand held out to it. I hope your mountain top still
holds the peace you first found there.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was this letter that Watts Shipman saved until
after his dinner, cooked by himself on a camp-fire out
under the trees and served deftly and frugally with a
sort of hermit cleanliness and economy. His pipe lit,
the russet head of Friar Tuck on his knee, the man
read and reread the pages. The deep eyes with their
curiously grave and faithful look were puzzled, the
long hands gripped once or twice on the paper, and
the mouth curled down on the pipe-stem with a look of
bafflement and grim disappointment.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" Watts kicked away a twig. He
changed his position on the log upon which he sat.
Putting the letter safely in an inside pocket, he got out
his knife and cut rather restlessly into a long smear of
yellow lichen on a tree. "It's rather queer that a
woman can talk like that, hold out her signal of distress
and then not tell you she needs you&mdash;it's a queer
thing," said Watts solemnly to his dog. "It's a queer
thing, only a good woman can withhold her <i>self</i>; a bad
woman can be subtle and elusive, a funny little beast,
plotting, dreaming greedy, little clawing dreams and
setting out her little poison traps for you, but a good
woman merely draws the veil and you&mdash;well, Tuck,
all you can do is to go home!"</p>

<p>Watts spoke the last words so loudly that Friar
Tuck rose once. "Woof, woof," he barked loudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
into his master's face. Watts laughed. "Hush, you
baby, I know I said 'go home,' but I'm not going
home, Tuck, no sir, not to those comfortable, luxurious
bachelor apartments, not until I've roughed it a
little longer and get the wisdom and rightness of the
woods into me. For we can't take another whole
summer off like this, boy, for a long time. We've got
to make it last, you old blasé clubman."</p>

<p>The evening grew late. A very light breeze moved
the tops of the hemlocks and their pointed heads
moved darkly like nodding cowls, their brooding spell
took the restlessness out of Shipman and he gazed
lovingly up into their fronded gloom. "Thank God
for trees, the great brotherhood of the woodland
priests," he murmured. Watts filled his pipe, gazing
affectionately at those dark brothers, saying softly,
"The Greeks got you better than we do, the souls
and conscience of you; they trained their minds to
regard you as some great principle connected with man
and woman and so it was easy for them to imagine you
as gods and goddesses. But we," grumbled the lawyer,
"we with our superb logic and 'practical' minds
have crystallized you into just 'trees,' things that we
plant for our shade and cut down for our fuel and on
which we grow fruit. Friends," said the man softly,
as he went to one tree trunk and laid his arm around
it, "walk with us like teachers; be one with us, take us
farther and farther into your counsels and your mysteries
and your reticences." Watts Shipman laughed
a little, then a guttural sound from Friar Tuck roused
him from his revery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"You did that before," pointing his pipe at the
russet head and solemn eyes. "You," accusingly,
"did that before." Friar Tuck groveled and whined.
Watts, leaning over to pat him, laughed.</p>

<p>"Tuck, old chap, why do you cringe so? I've
never hit you, nor as far as I know has any other man.
Why do you act so humbly? You know as much as I
do, the only difference is that you don't know you
know, and I do; but, after all, I only think I know,
and that doesn't prove anything, so cheer up, <i>mon
vieux</i>;" but at a distinctly menacing growl from the
dog, Watts walked to the edge of the cliff to where
his lamp was placed, and stared into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you old barometer, no one can be coming
up the mountain road at this hour, anyway not on this
spur." The man peered at his leather-cased wrist-watch.
"After eleven o'clock, and no one uses that
mountain road at night; the driving's rotten and the
walking's too craggy and storm-bitten for anything
but snakes and foxes. Unless&mdash;&mdash;" Watts thought
of the mysterious ways of moving-picture campers.
Going to the edge of the height on which the organ
builder's house stood, he peered down to the road
curving far underneath. "By all that's American!"
he breathed; "by the Great Original Flapper!"</p>

<p>For a long line of cars was ascending the steep
mountain road, winding in and out of the turns. The
young drivers, leaning out, cheered to each other, calling
challenges, experimenting with different gears, and
bawling advice and congratulations on the climbing
power of their machines. The lateness of the hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
seemed no curb to their haste or their assurance, nor
did the impassable road rouse a feeling of insecurity.
They were merely interested in the one car that should
reach the top first.</p>

<p>In Dunstan's roadster Minga was advocating a swift
rush that should pass the car ahead and gain the summit
speedily. Sard and the young lawyer tried by
their own prudence to communicate that saving quality
to the others; here a driver shook his fist at some
dare-devil brother, who passed him close to the ledge,
thereby badly crowding his neighbors, who in turn
swished into the road gutter until passed by one or two
speed cranks trying to beat each other.</p>

<p>When at last every car had reached the summit
there were confident giggles, little gasps from the girls
and a catcall of triumph, a harassed ejaculation from
the masculine drivers.</p>

<p>As they parked the machines in an orderly row on
the mountain top, the great lights glared and the black
forms crouched in powerful bulk on the uneven roadway,
while the short-skirted, jaunty figures alighted
with mingled sighs and stretches of relief.</p>

<p>"Moon's doing pretty well to-night," said Dunstan.
He kissed his hand to it, calling up to the sky,
"All right, Mr. God, we like your little old scout
moon. Some sky-dynamo, what? Savez? We like
it!"</p>

<p>They moved about, pawing with their feet, seeking
out the path over the mountain top. Their shadows
were elongated in the moonlight, for them there were
adventure and mystery in the bushes all about; scents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of spearmints and bay and the curious smell of rocky
plants came to them.</p>

<p>One lad sniffed the air. "I smell chewing-gum,"
he announced.</p>

<p>"I smell home brew stills," shouted another youth,
as he leaped up and grasped a branch like a young
monkey. "Right-o, lead on to your treasure cave and
your fair women slaves."</p>

<p>"We got the fair women slaves right here," insisted
another cub person; "all we need now is a cave
and the cavemen will proceed to register. Look your
prettiest, maidens. Put on your skins, your other
skins, and your necklaces."</p>

<p>The hilarity, rather artificial, was the organized hilarity
of the "young" groups of the day; like the
cheers of the colleges, the competitive "rah-rahs" of
directed "sides," the "fun" was stimulated by rather
jaded fun-leaders; so, as they entered the wooded
plateau where the organ builder's house stood, they
were fairly howling and bawling with self-conscious
youth and the sense of "whooping it up."</p>

<p>"Oh, Watts Shipman," shouted a Yale sophomore.
"Oh, Watts Shipman, put out your head."</p>

<p>"Oh, you criminal lawyer," howled another boy,
"free the slaves, burn the Bastille, burn the pastilles&mdash;Rah&mdash;Rah&mdash;Rah!
We want Terence, the great cut-throat
of the Hudson," and so in the pale sanctity of
the moonlight the group stumbled on, plunging, exhilarated,
a little uncertain and undecided and becoming
increasingly silly. At some not very emphatic
shrieks, giggles and rather over-done kissing sounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Sard turned sharply. The girl, hatless, a little glint
in her eyes, faced them. "I don't like this; you know
it's&mdash;it's not sensible."</p>

<p>"Ah," they said, "ah, the lady doesn't like it."</p>

<p>"I think we ought to take this thing more seriously,"
Sard continued with a little short breath of
indignation, adding more gently, "We don't really
know what we're up against. I've heard that Watts
Shipman is terribly reserved. We don't want to antagonize
him."</p>

<p>"I shan't antagonize him," came a fresh high voice.
"I shall vamp him. I shall twine around him like the
ivy in the snow."</p>

<p>They all chuckled. Minga, clad in scarlet sweater
and skirt, with the orange silk handkerchief bound
around her curls, suddenly slid into a bright patch of
moonlight where the trees were thinnest, making a
natural stage setting.</p>

<p>"I am terribly reserved," shrieked Minga in high
falsetto. "I am the primmest little prune in the
county. But I am some little dancer and don't you
forget it, and I will dance his eyes out of his head.
Ladies and gents," announced Minga, "the Pocahontas
Pep. Watch me!"</p>

<p>They stood there watching her prowling paces and
archly bold postures. The slender form bent almost
backward, the eyes filled with imaginary passion and
adventure and fear. When she ended with a lovely
fantastic rush and stampede, it is quite certain that
that grave Indian maiden, the estimable Pocahontas,
would have been as much fascinated as anyone else.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>At the catcalls and whoops of applause, Sard again
held up her hand.</p>

<p>"Minga," she pleaded, "Dunce, please, all of you."
Sard was very positive.</p>

<p>The solemn lawyer youth in the background, silently
adoring her, brightened as her voice took on asperity
and decision.</p>

<p>"This is really silly," she scolded; "it's&mdash;it's not
the way to do things. Didn't we come up here to try
to save Terence O'Brien?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Sure," soothed one of the boys. "Right-o!"
added one or two more.</p>

<p>"Well then," said Sard, "if I know a thing of
Watts Shipman from what I've heard Father say,"
she dropped her voice to persuasive entreaty. "No,
really, Minga! Dunce! we won't get a thing out of
that man if we act like this; he's very hard to deal
with; he's cold and aloof and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An altogether haughty and disagreeable person,"
said a deep voice.</p>

<p>The group turned quickly, and there in the moonlight,
his hand on the suspicious Friar Tuck's collar,
stood the lawyer.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; a sort of shiver ran
through the young people. It was a sensation they
quickly recognized, but to which they could give no
name; the voice and presence of spiritual poise, the
calm, inexorable deliberation of assured authority.</p>

<p>"How do you do, everybody?" said Watts quietly,
as quietly as he stood there waiting.</p>

<p>That "everybody," grave as it was, contained an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
informal welcome that Minga was quick to recognize.
She, who took hurdles as soon as they were presented,
now tried to jump the barrier of this stranger's powerful
personality. She stepped forward, a funny little
figure in scarlet, opposite to the tall khaki-clad repose
of the man.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Shipman?" came the little
voice in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Minga was glib at these numbers. "I've&mdash;we've
heard so much about you, awfully glad to meet you;
you know my cousin, Mrs. Ledyard, she's told me just
lots about you."</p>

<p>Watts swept a swift glance at the girl....
"Yes," he took Minga in and smiled, not unsympathetically,
"I know Mrs. Ledyard well; I am glad to
meet a cousin of hers. It's Miss Gerould, isn't it? I
am so glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Well," Minga, even before his indulgence, felt an
unaccountable awkwardness; the erstwhile Pocahontas
shifted from one foot to another while she dug
both hands in the patch pockets of her tennis skirt.
"I&mdash;we&mdash;er&mdash;just came up," she began; "we all sort
of&mdash;thought we'd like to know you."</p>

<p>Now the owl-eyed youth stepped forward with the
grand manner of the college debater.</p>

<p>"We come on behalf of Terence O'Brien," he began.
At the superior manner and the name, the great
lawyer stiffened ever so imperceptibly, but suddenly
the owl-eyed also lost courage, so that it was Sard who
was forced to lucidify things.</p>

<p>"We hope we aren't intruding." The girl's voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
was even and poised. Watts looked at her with interest.</p>

<p>"We are in great distress and trouble about something
and we believed that you could&mdash;that you
would help us."</p>

<p>"This is Judge Bogart's daughter," announced one
of the boys with the society drawl of the "important"
introduction.</p>

<p>The lawyer, standing there, bowed. The moonlight
disguised the look of curiosity, of humor, in his eyes;
he scanned this awed group in rather fantastic outdoor
get-up.</p>

<p>"It's a little late for calling, isn't it?" he suggested;
then, seeing a slight resentment on the part of the
owl-eyed, whom he instantly recognized as a struggler
along his own difficult path of the law, he relented.</p>

<p>"But delightful of you to climb way up here. Rather
wicked roads, I'm afraid; some able driving." With
a hospitable gesture he led the way to the clearing in
front of his house. Few of the young people had
been up here before; there were looks of frank curiosity
and expressions of wonder that a modern clubman
should choose to live in the organ builder's old
rookery.</p>

<p>"Well, it has its charm," explained Watts, his grim
mouth was humorous, "but I shan't ask you in; not
while the moon's like this! Now, if you fellows will
drag out rugs and some cushions for the girls&mdash;&mdash;"
He was busy receiving his midnight guests, as if all
were quite usual.</p>

<p>And quite usual it seemed to the young night hawks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
The boys, sitting on stumps, rolled cigarettes or filled
pipes; Minga and Gertrude also lit cigarettes, but the
former, at Sard's amused glance, tossed hers away;
the thing, still smouldering, dropped on some dried
pine needles. Shipman slowly turned from the owl-eyed
and his look went directly to the little wisp of
smoke.</p>

<p>"Your cigarette is still burning," he gestured toward
it, then courteously, "I am fire warden here;
won't you please put it out?"</p>

<p>It was as if he assumed that a modern girl would
prefer to do this herself, but Minga wilfully misunderstood
him. The little scarlet figure seated on the log
resented the authority back of the deep kind gaze bent
upon her. It was a stinging new experience for
Minga to be reminded of a duty, an experience like a
smart blow on the lithe little body, only it had none of
the brutality a blow must have; perhaps that was why
it stung. Minga hunched one shoulder; her eyes
snapped as she turned away.</p>

<p>"You can put it out yourself," was her pert remark.</p>

<p>There was a nervous giggle, then a sudden silence.
The scene in the moonlight was significant. The loafing,
negligent forms of the smoking youths, Sard
standing vibrant, clear, but irresolute and waiting.
Dunstan, the charmed faun look in his eyes, prone at
Minga's feet. The culprit flushed and annoyed, the
girls frankly open-mouthed and uncomprehending.
Again the owlish-eyed tried to take command.</p>

<p>"Allow me," with opera bouffe effect. He started
toward the smoking cigarette, but, bowing very slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with an almost curt gesture of refusal, Watts prevented
him.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, but in the capacity of fire warden, it
is my duty to see that an ordinary camp regulation is
obeyed." He turned to the provoked girl and, with
very slight but intentional irony, asked, "Do you know
the meaning of that word 'obey,' Miss Minga?"</p>

<p>Slowly the girl rose and stared into his face. Deciding
to say nothing, she gradually stiffened and a
hard look came into her eyes. "I&mdash;refuse&mdash;to&mdash;I,"
she tried for a lofty tone, but her voice was flat and
childish, "I&mdash;I am not accustomed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Watts quietly. "The Mede and
the Persian haven't been successful with you in that,
have they?&mdash;though they've let you become so charming.
You see," he smiled, "I've heard of you, Miss
Minga."</p>

<p>At this the group writhed; one or two giggled a
little uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Insulting," breathed one lad dramatically. He
put his hand first into one pocket and then the other;
another cub person solemnly took out and considered
a revolver but their host took little notice.</p>

<p>"You see," said Watts, with an air of imparting information,
"I believe in obedience&mdash;of course, I
shan't order you to put out the cigarette, Miss Gerould,
but obliged as I am to you all for this&mdash;er&mdash;interest,
yet after all you are my guest and, well, guests,
even in America, still like to consider the preferences
of the host and my preference is to observe forest
laws."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an indeterminate silence. Loyalty to
Minga, and their quick moving picture sense of outrage,
made them wish to murder this man, who was so
quiet and so direct. "Who," thought the owl-eyed,
"was this stranger to command them all, order them
around?" Yet the thought Watts had just expressed
seemed to them rather obvious; they had come uninvited
into this man's camp. It seemed only decency to
observe the rules. As they stood uncomfortably irresolute,
they saw with wide-open eyes a strange thing
happen.</p>

<p>Watts Shipman stood in front of their little friend
in scarlet, not touching her, only looking at her. Very
slowly and calmly the man motioned toward the cigarette
smouldering on the turf; very quietly, almost
imperceptibly, he motioned the girl toward it. Minga
rose like one in a trance, her eyes fixed unwillingly on
those of the lawyer. Putting out one little canvas-shod
foot, at first irresolutely, then with sudden vehemence
she rubbed the burning cigarette into the
ground till all saw that it was extinguished. The girl
turned her face in the moonlight. It was broken with
rage. "<i>I hate you. I hate you</i>," she breathed. Her
teeth seemed to chatter with her sudden fury.</p>

<p>Watts held out both hands. "I'm sorry," he said
simply, "but I think you know that I have done right."</p>

<p>The group of youngsters stood silent and amazed in
the moonlight. They had beheld a thing as rare in
America as lions and tigers; they had witnessed the
power of just, quiet and inexorable spiritual authority,
compelling obedience. Minga, looking around for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
sympathy, read no answering rebellion in their eyes.
With a strange, an almost animal cry, the girl darted
over to Dunstan Bogart. "Oh, Dunce," she choked,
almost screaming, "get me away from here&mdash;get me
away, I tell you!"</p>

<p>She turned and dashed out of the circle into the
rough mountain road, where they saw her stumbling
like a driven thing; Dunstan Bogart, without an instant's
hesitation, following her. The boy's eyes were
glittering, his head held high in a sort of pride of
championship. In a moment their car, tightly braked,
was edging cautiously down the rock-hewn road.</p>

<p>When at last they reached the levels, the boy suddenly
reaching over, put his hand on his companion's,
who sat rigid, immovable beside him. Minga looked
at him fiercely a second time, with eyes that were hot
with tears; she sobbed, "Oh, I'm <i>wild</i>." When they
pulled up at the Bogarts' garage she drew a long,
shuddering breath, and her champion, staring amazedly
at her, saw her face drenched with angry crying.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Dunstan. "What do you care&mdash;that
old granny on the mountain top! Why should
you care?"</p>

<p>"I wish I was home," said Minga, fiercely. "Oh,
I wish I was home." The sheltering tenderness of the
Mede and Persian would have been very grateful just
then to their little daughter.</p>

<p>"Minga," said Dunce earnestly, "I could have
brained that brute; so could the other chaps. What
business had he to&mdash;- He'll get his yet."</p>

<p>"I hate him, I hate him," repeated the girl viciously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
She twisted her handkerchief in her hands and her
eyes grew wide with something now unaccountable.
While she fought for self-possession, the boy beside
her, with a tenderness he hardly understood, stroked
the soft, curly head; he uttered clumsy words of comfort.</p>

<p>"Any man," said Dunstan, "any man who would do
such a thing is a pretty low sort of cur."</p>

<p>"He isn't just a cur," objected Minga miserably;
"a cur could&mdash;couldn't make me f-feel like this."</p>

<p>"Well, he's a comic supplement,"&mdash;Dunce snapped
his teeth viciously, "he's a&mdash;an Egyptian obelisk,"
raged the boy, "and I'd like to cut some more hieroglyphics
on him."</p>

<p>So the two sat in the little roadster, arrested in their
impulsive pampered lives by one of the greatest laws
that has ever been laid on humanity, the Law of Obedience,
incoherent in their inner warrings of hurt
pride, they tried to sustain each other. Dunstan's
awkward arm went once around Minga's little red-clad
figure; he strove in a callow way to be tender,
but only for a moment.</p>

<p>For a tempestuous Minga stood up straight in the
car.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sa-sake," she demanded with a slight
sob, "For Heaven's sake,"&mdash;gulp&mdash;"what do you
think this is, Dunce Bogart, one of those petting
parties? Do you think I'm a park lady or one of
those Sunday-school picnic vamps?"</p>

<p>Dunce looked sheepishly determined. "You remember
what I said that first night," he said solemnly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
"that I'd kiss you again&mdash;and better&mdash;that's what
you'll&mdash;you'll feel, some day."</p>

<p>To her disdainful silence he went on, "Well, I
haven't yet, but I'm going to; you wait." He wagged
his head.</p>

<p>But there was a little distressed quiver in her voice,
and the essential manhood in Dunstan answered it
with gentleness. He himself rose and the two
climbed soberly down out of the car. Through the
great trees they saw the cathedral moonlight still silvering
all the world and the sleep and quiet, the majesty
of the night, touched them. They saw depths of
life that they had never fathomed; depths that saddened
and frightened them. Together they softly
closed the garage doors, together they entered the dark
house and crept slowly up-stairs.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Minga," said Dunstan softly. "Do
you care that&mdash;that I was there&mdash;&mdash;" The boy looked
solemnly at her.</p>

<p>The girl, pausing at the door of her room, lifted her
head and looked at him. "You were the only decent
person on the whole trip," she said softly. She put
her hand in his; it was cold and little. Dunstan, wondering,
felt it tremble.</p>

<p>When a boy goes to bed remembering a girl's trembling
hand does he ever ask himself who made that
hand tremble, or does he always feel sure that it was
he who stirred the young life to quivering?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class="center">TERMS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sudden abandonment of the Terence O'Brien
crusade by Minga and Dunstan cast a chill over the
other plotters and a sort of obstinate silence settled
down on the young intruders on Watts Shipman's
privacy. One of the boys got up, put his hands in his
pockets and walked aimlessly about, kicking at pebbles
and whistling; the girls' voices took on drawling
inflections of careless indifference. The young lawyer
tried some professional small talk that sounded oddly
in the poetic surroundings of forest moonlight to which
the senior listened without much interest. Shipman,
with an amused sense of liking to see these calm
young persons at a disadvantage, wondered if they
would not under the awkward stress of the thing develop
a few sensibilities, but he allowed the moment to
remain as clumsy as it might be.</p>

<p>The only one who realized the man's inner comment
was Sard; she it was who had fretted helplessly at the
inopportune behavior of her girl friend; nettled, she
now resolved that the meeting should be opened and
she moved a little on the log where she sat.</p>

<p>Watts rose and gravely motioned her to take his
abandoned seat. "You see the river better from
there," he urged. "Rather nice in the moonlight,
don't you think? You know Drake's 'Culprit Fay'?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Of course, such a delicate poem, made of shells and
straws and fairies' wings with this monster stream for
background"&mdash;he shrugged, scanning the girl's face,
saying lightly,&mdash;"Do you suppose all this beauty really
got through the Dutchman's skin, or did it lie dormant
till Irving brought it to life? A pity, after those 'historic
fires of liberty,' and a young woman's college
adorning it, and all the tremendous striking events of
its history, that this river's chief ornaments should be
a prison, a military academy and a lot of rich men's
homes! Have you ever thought," went on Shipman
purposefully, "what a marvelous thing it would be if
we could have heroic statuary all along our river
banks, really heroic statuary, sculpture of the great
deeds of discovery, the statues of men who invented
things for human good, great inventors, great mothers,
great scientists, great writers, great explorers; not a
single statue that should spell wars or the glory of
wars, but all the superb names that bear witness to the
everlasting wonder and glory and forward looking of
Human Life."</p>

<p>Of course, this exhortation was to put her at her
ease. The girl recognized this, and while she hardly
heard the words of the man standing there, she
thanked him mentally. As Sard met Shipman's eyes
she tried to look as if she, at least, had completely
forgotten the Minga incident. Anyway, Sard had
seen things like that happen to Minga before. Only,
in all those two years at college, reflected the girl,
Minga had never been so completely, so lamentably
driven from her accustomed aplomb. The thing did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
not make Sard like the great man any too well, but the
memory of the figure of poor Dora at her work, the
sense of a boy of Dunce's age going to prison "for
life," these things spurred her on to what she had to
say.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we ought to apologize for coming up here
like this," began the girl tentatively, "but," she
laughed a little, "I don't think we will."</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine your having ever to apologize."
Watts' eyes were upon her, the expression in them
very different from that with which he had subdued
Minga. He looked a sort of wondering admiration, as
a man may at the young face and figure so exquisitely
balanced in so complete a dignity. To Watts' keen
knowledge of human personality, Sard spelled clarity,
essential purity; but it was not ignorant purity nor
insulated clarity. It was the healthy nerve and sparkle
of an original daring nature, something direct and
vigorous that went straight to its interests and issues
in a direct, fresh way, that looked things in the face
and tackled them in front.</p>

<p>"We,"&mdash;Sard looked around at her rather ineffectual
supporters,&mdash;"we believe that you can help us
about something&mdash;someone&mdash;Terence O'Brien," the
girl blurted it out to the famous lawyer with a little
catch of the breath. Her voice, naturally liquid, was
a little husky, but she held herself admirably.</p>

<p>"The man who is held for murder?" the lawyer's
voice was grave.</p>

<p>"The boy,"&mdash;with ever so slight an insistence on
"the boy,"&mdash;"who killed that old cobbler." Sard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
glanced eagerly into Watts' face. "We have been
talking about it, all of us, a great deal; all Willow
Roads is excited over it because he is so young."
The girl hesitated a moment, then she said simply, "I
haven't been able to discuss it with my father
but&mdash;&mdash;" Sard paused; something she had not reckoned
with of embarrassment seemed to thicken her
throat, but she plunged bravely on. "Life sentence is
what everyone thinks he will get, life sentence." Her
hand went out with a curious despairing little gesture
that Watts noted with concern. She turned on him
dark eyes, womanly, tragic. "Life! Have we&mdash;has
anyone the right to take from anyone so young the
chance to try again?"</p>

<p>The lawyer instinctively admired the girl for her
directness, and he met her with equal directness.
"No," he said, "we haven't, no one has, under any
circumstances, the right to take life but in such cases
we choose a lesser evil instead of a perfect good.
Here the problem is that this boy, for a small amount
of money, wantonly killed an old man, who had befriended
him, trusted him; 'murder,'" said Watts
emphatically, "is on his soul&mdash;do you think he would
have strength to live again?"</p>

<p>It was stated very simply, but with such unadorned
clearness that Sard shivered. Shipman, without
speaking, got up and went into the house, presently
emerging with some light steamer rugs and Italian
blankets, one of which he drew around Sard's shoulders.
He motioned in a big brotherly way to the
somewhat subdued girls of the party, "I'm afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
you're all cold. Shall we go in? Haven't you sweaters
or something?"</p>

<p>But something stiff in this little party made them
refuse to enter the house; it might almost have been
that this strange man who lived in the organ builder's
house had so impressed them by a sense of inherent
personal power that they felt actually safer outdoors.
Anyway, Minga, the little scarlet leader of all their
pranks and escapades, their rather elaborately planned
defiances and simulated viciousness, had been shamed
by this man. Sard, it seemed, also remembered it;
however, she did not refuse the Italian blanket, though
she let it slip to her knees. The lawyer noted this,
and the corners of his mouth moved slightly.</p>

<p>He turned to the younger practitioner of his profession.
"It is an ugly case," he remarked gravely.
"The way it was done," he made a gesture of disgust,
"the boy must have something essentially
sneaky and cold in him. There are natures like that,"
he turned to Sard, "natures that you could hardly,
with all your imagination, realize or comprehend."</p>

<p>So the group sat in the moonlight discussing the
thing. One by one the lawyer drew the young philanthropists
out. Under the rather marked paucity of
expression he found the same impulse, the broad human
wish to give this boy, caught like a fly in the net
of the law, "another chance." Watts quietly relaxed,
sat there in the moonlight, studying the sober young
faces. Finally he spoke the thing that had first of all
come into his mind.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought not to ask this," turning to Sard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
"but your father, in this county, is the Law and
Prophets. The country people dote on his judgments;
they trust him; somehow I should think no lawyer
would influence his decision, no jury's verdict interfere
with his sentence. He, I should think in talking
with you, would be able to make you feel the essential
inevitability of the thing."</p>

<p>There was silence as the group faced him, such deep
solemnity on the young faces that Shipman all but
laughed; the lawyer, accustomed as he was to studying
all phases of human conduct, found himself
amazed at the unanimity of serious purposes underlying
this group that he knew to be the most unruly,
unpromising of all unpromising small-town groups.</p>

<p>"Judge Bogart is an infallible man," he repeated
softly. "His suggestions&mdash;&mdash;" It was evident that
the lawyer expected a "suggestion" from Judge Bogart's
daughter.</p>

<p>But it was as if Sard had hardly heard him. At
last: "My father prefers not to discuss these things
with us." The girl said it very quietly and there was
no hint of criticism of her father, but she went on
thoughtfully, "Perhaps, though, he belongs to something
that is becoming worn out," again she made the
curious despairing little gesture, "mightn't it be possible
that some day all these things will be changed,
that there will be no more 'life sentences,' that we
who come after will see the way to make things better,
fairer?"</p>

<p>Shipman laughed a little ironically; he turned to
the young lawyer. "How would Miss Bogart like it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
if she had to give the life sentences?" he asked lightly,
but the girl had her answer ready and she gave it
with a powerful conviction that arrested him.</p>

<p>"I should not want to live myself," she said in low,
distinct tones. "I should not want to live if I thought
we should always have to have crime in the world."
Sard faced him a little defiantly; she was remembering
the voice of poor Dora in the kitchen. "Is it
justice," I ask you, "is it justice to take a young boy
like that, take him for life, never give him another
chance?"</p>

<p>Another of the group now spoke up. "Lots of
men and women are at large who ought to be in
prison."</p>

<p>Watts smiled. "Lots of boats do sink on the sea,
but that is no reason why we should build our boats so
that they will sink. Law, you see, is society's effort to
protect its best from its worst." He looked interestedly
at the young speaker. "You couldn't marry and
have a home without law," curiously studying the boy.</p>

<p>"And I couldn't get a divorce without law, some
kinds," grinned the cub. It was a technical retort, the
typical "smart" answer of the up-to-date youngster.
It gave his group courage; there were various asides
among the members of the circle, a few titters and
smothered witticisms.</p>

<p>Shipman rather enjoyed the little drama being enacted
before him; he smoked imperturbably while he
appeared to give this answer thought. "I suppose we
ought to remember that the law that makes divorce
possible rose first in the minds of men and women,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
he said evenly. "But we must ask ourselves how
well those minds are instructed. In any case, I take
it, the law, no matter how badly interpreted, is society's
weapon against itself! New laws put upon
paper and framed by act of Legislature or of Congress
are to counteract certain old laws which were inadequate.
When I insisted that your little friend extinguish
her cigarette," the lawyer gravely searched the
darkening faces in the moonlight, "it was merely to
enforce a law which makes forest fires less probable.
When I enact a law that separates a good woman from
a bad man or vice versa, I protect the weaker against
the stronger; when I support a law that insists that a
boy's liberty be taken from him, after a dastardly
murder, I make it possible for people to move about
with varying degrees of safety from like murder. It
is not my affair if these laws are not modified. It is
for you and people like you to keep laws and by keeping
them gain the power to make better ones."</p>

<p>The circle, a little daunted by his calm willingness
to discuss, were disposed to receive this without comment.
The little lawyer in the owl glasses kicked
rather disconsolately at a bunch of turf, the other lads
fidgeted. Somehow the crusade to intercede on behalf
of Terence O'Brien had lost its moving-picture
sensationalism. They realized that they had run up
against a quiet man of steel and iron, who was more
or less amused and not very impressed by them; there
were murmurings and half-formed suggestions that
they should leave until Sard, with a kind of resolution,
rose suddenly from her seat and stood in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Shipman. She looked directly into his face and he
saw determination in her; the sort that does and dies,
but does not abandon its object.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I believe you are kind," said the girl, in a low
questioning tone.</p>

<p>The man, a little surprised, waited gravely.</p>

<p>Sard spoke rather timidly. "I understand how you
and other lawyers look at these things, by rote, sort
of, isn't it? And you forget it is men and women
you deal with; only 'cases' and knotty 'points,' isn't
that true?"</p>

<p>Watts, rather piqued, bowed in answer.</p>

<p>"And I know," said Sard quickly&mdash;"it seems queer
to ask it, but you, a man of your power, could influence
a country jury, couldn't you, from your way of
putting a thing, from your knowledge of how to speak
to the point? Would you," the girl looked eagerly
into the half-shadowed face, "would you be willing
to appear for Terry's defense if&mdash;we&mdash;we paid you
any fee you asked? I think we could get the money
some way." The girl was clearly nervous now; her
breath came a little quicker as she stood her ground,
saying simply, helplessly, "Would you?"</p>

<p>Watts marveled at her. This man knew the way a
person with a deep conviction always acted, and no
one more solemnly respected conviction. It was the
steady return to the subject in hand, the resolute persistence,
in spite of every objection and obstacle, that
won the great lawyer's respect and admiration. Suddenly
a gleam came over his face and he rose, standing
as Sard stood, answering her as simply. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
have interested me," he said quietly; "it is true that I
am here for a season of rest, but if the trial comes off,
as I think you said, in the early fall, I believe it will
be held in your father's jurisdiction."</p>

<p>Sard nodded, her eyes fixed upon him.</p>

<p>The lawyer stood, his hands in his coat pockets, his
eyes on the ground, considering. Suddenly he looked
up and addressed the wide-eyed circle. "I should ask
one sort of fee only."</p>

<p>This consent of itself was so sudden, so unhoped
for, that a thrill went around the group; someone in
the circle fairly gasped. Casual, indulged, the young
people had hardly tackled the question of a great lawyer's
fee; the youngsters waited, jaws dropping to
hear the spokesman's answer.</p>

<p>"From you," Shipman turned to Sard, "I should
only ask coöperation along lines which we will work
out together; from you," turning to the little lawyer,
"I must beg the privilege of an occasional conference."</p>

<p>The little owl-eyed bowed a solemn and somewhat
puffed-up acknowledgment. But Shipman, with eyes
enigmatic, turned upon the rest of the group, "I feel
that to obtain a&mdash;er&mdash;certain solidarity, that my fee
should come from all of you. Taxing each one of you
a certain percentage per month would, of course, make
a hole in your allowances&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Instantly the curious derisive protest went up. The
group had grown gradually less in awe of the great
man. Now they openly rebelled while they were half
agreed. Those whose murmurings were in earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
were smothered by their companions who bade them
be "sports." At last someone stepped forward gracefully,
offering his hand. It was the youth with the
new blue car. Watts gripped his young paw with
liking. The others then followed in rapid succession.
"Good-bye, chocolate sundaes," said somebody with a
groan. "Where do we get off, at the poorhouse?"
asked another cub. "Farewell, my wrist-watch, good-bye,
golf caddies; me for the lessening waistband,"
they giggled and shuffled and hooted their dismay,
knowing well that what the man before them asked
was no real hardship, yet making their reluctance very
evident. Watts noted with wonder, however, that in
this, as in everything else, they kept to their squad
formation, one man having agreed, all agreed. Someone
then suggested gruffly that it was time to depart.
With awkward leave-taking and self-conscious thanks
they finally took themselves away.</p>

<p>All but Sard, who hesitated in the lull occasioned
by the departing group, again callow, vociferous, with
a sense of restraint removed.</p>

<p>Shipman, an enigmatic expression on his face,
turned to her and held out his hand. "Will you forgive
me?"</p>

<p>The girl, wondering, hesitated, but Shipman, the
fine cool hand once in his, did not let it go too quickly.
"I have treated your friends pretty meanly," he said,
"but I wanted to see if they really mean anything."</p>

<p>The girl returned his gaze; for the first time he saw
challenge in the fine young eyes, and his own leaped
to their full power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"You saw?" asked Sard coolly.</p>

<p>Shipman threw back his head, but his laugh was not
quite as assured as usual.</p>

<p>"You haven't forgiven me!" He pretended amusement.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the girl, a little bitterly, remembering
his earlier remarks, "I have to protect society
from you." The lawyer winced; his hand quickly relinquished
hers and dropped to his side.</p>

<p>"You mean?" he said quickly; the man took a step
forward, staring into her face&mdash;"I wonder what you
do mean."</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Sard, her voice quivered a little,
but she made the effort to be businesslike, "you
will let me know what you can in connection with the
case, with Terence," then a sudden little impulsive
softening, "I do thank you. I know that you have
been kind and patient with us." She motioned to the
solemn-eyed one waiting at a little distance for her.
"I must hurry. Good-night!"</p>

<p>They shook hands again, this time a something of
liking between them, and Shipman watched the girl
step confidently out of his wondering observation.</p>

<p>Car after car curved away down the steep road,
young voice after young voice died on the midnight
mountain echoes, but until very late indeed a man
stood looking out upon the moonlit Hudson, and it
seemed to Watts Shipman that the whole mountain
said, that all the trees and rocks and stars and ripples
said to each other one significant word and that word
was "Youth."</p>

<div class="center">THE MAN ON THE PLACE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Will</span> you do something for me?" Sard had asked
Minga on the day of her friend's arrival. Later she
had made the request that Minga lead up to the subject
of Terence O'Brien; only because she had lost the
courage to speak of the thing that those days was continually
in her mind; namely, the mystery of the new
man Colter. He, who busied himself quietly all day
about the drives and shrubberies and caring for the
cars, and who, at night, she saw strolling around to
the garden seat to listen to the music of the Judge's
pet records. But now, after a comradeship of two
weeks, much of Sard's restraint had vanished, so that
as the two girls glided in the little roadster out of
Bogart's drive one morning and Minga asked curiously,
"What was that thing, Sardy, that you were
going to tell me?" her friend's answering laugh was
less conscious than it might have been.</p>

<p>"Oh, I want you to pass on a discovery of mine;
something I've got out in the garage."</p>

<p>"A pup?" Minga was politely interrogative.</p>

<p>Sard bent to shift gears; she smiled cryptically.
"No, no, not a dog; but I picked it up and brought it
home the way one would a badly used dog. It's
partly Aunt Reely's pet, too," added Sard gravely;
"she gives him advice, but I found him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"A turtle," guessed Minga idly; "one doesn't give
a turtle advice, though, does one? Oh," she turned
an accusing face on her friend, "I'll bet it is just that
horrid old man, a plain, dirty tramp." Immediately
the little figure in scarlet lost interest, and as the car
glided softly along the river road and up toward the
little valley village of Morris, Sard frowned thoughtfully.
"Just the same, I want you to pass on him,"
said the older girl; "he's rather a strange specimen,
Minga." Asked her friend abruptly, "Have you ever
seen a case of amnesia?"</p>

<p>Minga, wrinkling her brows, remembered that there
was a girl who studied too hard at college and she
had amnesia and couldn't remember to put her clothes
on properly. "That," said Minga, with emphasis,
"made me decide right then that I would never study
too hard. But I never saw any amnesia," added
Minga. "Is it anything like asthma?"</p>

<p>"It's like the light going out of your head, I guess,"
said Sard, "and the paths of your mind don't lead
home; don't lead to the You that knows you; and it
will make all the yous suddenly run into each other,
and you are suddenly lost. For instance, I could have
amnesia so that I could see you, but there wouldn't be
any me. You know, the recognition part of me
would be all thin air, and objects stuck in it like houses
and men and women that meant nothing. I've been
reading it up," explained Sard.</p>

<p>Minga shivered. "Don't describe such awful
things," she begged.</p>

<p>"But it's interesting." There was a reflective light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in the other's eyes. "I was born to be a psychologist,
I guess, because such things interest me. Think, for
instance, of not knowing who one is, or one's own
people! Or perhaps standing right in front of one's
home and not recognizing it! Such things happen.
Like doors closing on the room where the mind used
to live, and turning the mind out into a cold new world
where it can't take hold, where it has words and intelligence,
but no recognitions."</p>

<p>"Wow!" Minga twisted an unwilling shoulder.
"Stop talking about it. Shut up!"</p>

<p>"Well," argued Sard, "that's what I think is the
matter with that man we've got right before our eyes.
Dad and Aunt Reely say it isn't so, of course; they say
I imagine too much." A very slight irritation crept
into the sober young face that scanned the road ahead.
"Older people go in for peace and comfort more than
anything else, don't they?"</p>

<p>"I think maybe it's more just public opinion," said
Minga, rather penetratingly for her rattle brain.
"Older people get used to what their set says and
does, and it just becomes sort of home life for them
and they don't want anything else. They refuse to
get out and think outside of what that set thinks and
does, because it wouldn't be cosy; it's like going out on
a winter trail when everybody is home sitting by the
fire. They want to sit by the fire. They don't want
to progress."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be 'popular,' I suppose." Sard avoided
a bump. "It's funny, but I keep thinking that if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
good things are to be accomplished we'll have to get
rid of popularity."</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't," said Minga. "Popularity?
You can't get anywhere in America unless you are
popular; but," the little philosopher added solemnly,
"isn't it queer, Sard, that&mdash;that we all, you and I and
all of us, have got to run the world some day whether
we want to or not? Everybody else will be dead&mdash;all
the aunts and fathers and mothers," Minga shivered
a little&mdash;"and we, we shall have to sign the bills
and give the sentences and be responsible." Minga
looked dreamingly at the wind-shield and at the cars
flashing by them. She clearly did not like the prospect.</p>

<p>The older girl nodded. Sard guided her car up to
the curb in front of the little Morris bank.</p>

<p>"What are you going in for?"</p>

<p>Sard flashed a smile. "Well, I&mdash;I am going in to
pay Mr. Lowden, that's the cashier, some money I
borrowed the day I found this man Colter. You see,"
added Sard casually, "I found him in the gutter up
here in Morris and I had no place to take him to nor
any money and Mr. Lowden managed for me. He
seemed to know what to do." Sard got out and
leaned against the car. Her straight, slim personality
in its turquoise blue cap and scarf was a lively bit
of poised youth; she stood twinkling into Minga's
perturbed eyes as she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll have to get used to my queer people
that I try to rescue," then, "when we go back I'm
going to take you to the garage and show Colter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
you and then you've got to put on your thinking cap
and tell me what has happened to him and what he
is!"</p>

<p>"Of all things," breathed little Minga with disgust,
"and there's a rip in your sleeve, too," she
added in tones of injury. "Sard, don't go and get
queer and interested in things that awful way that
some girls do." Minga was clearly aggrieved.</p>

<p>But Sard had run up the bank steps and turned
in the direction of the cashier's office. Through the
plate glass window she bowed to the president; his
massive head and broad low brow and deep-set eyes
emphasized a rather unusual type of the quiet country
gentleman. Stepping into the partitioned consulting-room
the girl found someone already in conference
with the cashier. It was Watts Shipman. Sard drew
back. "Oh, I'm intruding." She was hesitant.</p>

<p>"No, indeed;" both men rose with cordial insistence.
"I was just going," said Shipman reassuringly.</p>

<p>The girl flushed. "I can come back again," then
something steadying her, to the cashier, "I wanted
to settle with you, Mr. Lowden, about our man Colter.
You were so kind that day, you helped me so
wonderfully." She smiled a little shyly. "For a moment
I didn't know what to do."</p>

<p>The man made courteous deprecation. "I was so
glad to be of service." Anticipating the girl's wish,
he put a slip of paper into her hand, and Sard read
it interestedly, her brows raised.</p>

<p>"This can't be all. He was two nights at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
boarding-house, I think, and his clothes were pressed
and laundered&mdash;and&mdash;someone got him shoes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just the same," the young fellow laughed, "that's
all it is. I strongly suspect, Miss Bogart, that the
village philanthropists were as much interested in your
case as you were, only," he sighed a little, "you took
the lead. You were the real Samaritan; the rest of
us might&mdash;well, it is just possible we could have
passed that man day after day until he dropped dead
from neglect and exhaustion. The doctor said it
was only a question of a few hours more without
food."</p>

<p>"You would have believed he was a tramp," excused
Sard. Though she knew it was no excuse.</p>

<p>"But you knew that he was not a tramp," said the
man quietly. Then as he gravely acknowledged the
sum Sard laid on the desk, "Does he grow more
coherent?"</p>

<p>Sard looked grateful for this intelligent interest, so
different from the sensational kind manifested by
other acquaintances. "He just works," she said
thoughtfully, "works and reads and says very little.
He almost never goes to the kitchen as the other men
we employ do, and he reads a great deal and takes
long walks. He knows the countryside thoroughly
and if you ask him questions about flowers, he tells
you queer scientific things, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>The look of interest on the face of the lawyer sitting
here made the girl pause; an inherent reticence
in Sard was a noticeable characteristic. Before Shipman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>she was on her guard; with a little nod she turned
and was gone.</p>

<p>The two men, admiring, noted the quick decision,
the arrest of confidence, and smiled at each other.</p>

<p>"It was Miss Bogart who headed my cavalcade last
night," said Shipman, "and she was spokeswoman for
the O'Brien matter. Has she, do you think, much
influence with her father?"</p>

<p>The young cashier put his finger-tips together.
"With Bogart? Did you ever know anyone who ever
had any influence with Bogart? You don't know the
man; he's not modern in any sense. He has the hard
and fixed ideas of crime and punishment. He believes
in the Example. Punishment is his fetich.
From his point of view, if he gives this young chap a
life sentence, fewer old men will get shot in the back.
That's Bogart's point of view." The cashier ruminated
for a few moments, then added, "any jury
knows it and plays upon it."</p>

<p>His visitor nodded, then smiled a rather dry smile.
"It might, however, eventually mean more old men
shot in the back," he said. Then rising, "Well, I've
enjoyed our talk and thanks for helping me out with
this scheme of the ransoming of Terence, by that
young crowd. It is funny, but it is significant, and
they mean business. They will pay a certain sum per
head into your hands Saturday nights, and it goes
into the O'Brien fund." The lawyer hesitated, adding
in a low voice, "I need not tell you that I cannot save
the chap. I know that he did the thing, but I mean
to try and get a shorter sentence, twenty years perhaps,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>he shrugged his shoulders, adding, "and you
and I know precisely what a man's life is worth after
twenty years in prison."</p>

<p>"How about a game of golf on the Wedgewood
course to-morrow? You want to get your revenge?"</p>

<p>They shook hands on it; the younger man looked
into the dark eyes, so full of human kindness, yet so
austere and lonely.</p>

<p>"Watts Shipman," the young cashier said slowly,
"what are you doing up there on that mountain?
Anything you shouldn't&mdash;home brew,&mdash;sirens?"</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed; he caught up his riding crop.
"Come up and see; walk up, do you good to climb
that far; no wine, no women, not even some of our
best suppressed literature. I'm&mdash;I'm just trying," the
lawyer threw back his head and drew a deep breath,
"to get hold of life, real life, the kind of thing that
eludes men until too late they turn and clutch for
it."</p>

<p>The other laughed. "And so you saw wood and
wash your own dishes? Wonderful realization of
life!"</p>

<p>Shipman's mouth twisted into appreciation of the
thing. "I've got a vegetable garden&mdash;raise nearly all
my own produce. I've planted it in terraces half
down the mountainside the way the Greeks do in
Thessaly. That's a wonderful scheme for natural irrigation.
Anyway," the lawyer squared away and
delivered a teasing punch on his friend's chest, "I've
got back a good digestion and can stretch like a
tiger and feel the morning sun along my bare flanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and&mdash;and I can laugh heartily, and I've forgotten the
smell of money and I've gone back to a boyish repugnance
for dirty things and lying things and under-handed
things." The older man cast a penetrating
look into the very stuff of his friend. "Isn't it up to
us to create new standards?" he asked squarely; "are
you satisfied with the old? I'm not! I want clean
standards, but I want 'em built on facts, not on calendar
mottoes."</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "So do I," he said in a
low tone, "but," he waved his hand to the street outside,
"do you see much out there that looks like new
standards? It's the calendar motto still." For a moment
the two men stood in the window reading the
street like a book on which figures of men and women
like words told the story of the vicinity. Morris's
mild, plainly-dressed women doing the morning's
marketing, face, features and walk betokening a certain
niggardliness with life; a complacent adjustment
to the best that has been instead of an insistence upon
the best that shall be. Occasional handsome cars
holding peevish city faces come to the country for a
great poison herb, Novelty. Young people flitting
about in droves driven by insatiability and their peculiar
disease, leisure and unapplied brains. One or
two old forms tottering in the sunshine, pleased, interested
with little trivial occurrences, yet powerful,
holding the power of prestige. The usual village
types, the static parson, the elastic politician, the
loafers on the corner, the nameless village woman,
the scoundrel village man, the sanctimonious gossips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the schools at twelve pouring out of their hoppers
the little victims of all whatever good or ill might be;
up and down the streets, these forms, symbols of
life, moved and went about their business. But no
matter what they spelled in between they wrote irrevocably
on the pavements, Greed, and also Fear,
and Popularity. They did not write Progress.</p>

<p>Watts, his dark face turned on the others, looked
inquiringly. "The same as Athens under Pericles, I
suppose?" he questioned. "The great souls come and
go and agonize and cry in the wilderness, and the
little souls determine what shall be." He held out his
hand once more and the other gripped it.</p>

<p>"You talk like a man-Cassandra," the cashier
grumbled, "but I'm coming up on your old mountain
top to hear some more of your wild stuff."</p>

<p>As Shipman passed down the bank steps he saw
the Bogart car sail by and the two tams, the red and
the blue, bobbed gaily at him. "See you at the dance
next Saturday." It was Minga who called this carelessly.
It was the same Minga who a few nights ago
on the mountain top had told Watts Shipman she
hated him. Now her vivid face framed in its blowing
curls looked calm appreciation. The Bunch were
"for" Watts; also the big club dance was in the air;
her instinct for collecting partners bade her forget
the cigarette episode. Watts, while he raised his eyebrows,
gestured enthusiastically. Sard also waved her
hand, and the flash of her deep eyes got to the man in
a way she might not have intended. For a moment
he stood and looked after them down the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
little street of Morris. It was the blue tam-o'-shanter
that still filled his vision.</p>

<p>"Blue ran the flash across," he quoted thoughtfully.
But it was not of blue violets that the great
lawyer was thinking; it was of personality, of personality
that was like a flame, flashing across dullness
and smugness and cheap pride, to what cost? Watts
Shipman, climbing to his mountain top, questioned,
for no man knew better than he the painful cost of
honest personality.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class="center">PEARS AND POETRY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> toward the rear of the Judge's place there
were garden paths set about with horny fruit trees.
A small plot of low-growing vegetables; a strip of turf
and a square of bean poles, made a jungle of kitchen
produce. As the season advanced, early summer
pears of a soft yellow, rosy-cheeked sort, began to
hang in globules on the gray-flaked trees. Here Colter
sometimes worked under the Judge's snapped
comments, or sat at luncheon hour, preferring to eat
here rather than in the comfortable kitchen; and here,
because of its almost jungle-like inaccessibility, Sard,
wandering from the house, would sometimes sit in
the long slumberous grasses and read. No one else
cared much for the vegetable plot nor for the yellow
pears. Miss Aurelia stayed away on the ground of
wasps; the Judge found that the grass ruined his
highly polished boots; the cook and the waitresses had
prejudices connected with snakes, but Sard wondered
if the "man on the place" ever saw, as she, lying on
her back, sometimes saw, the romance of this nook.
The tent of the blue sky, the silken whir of birds winging
through, the syncopatic throb of life in the grass
all around, the Dervish-like attitude of the old trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
holding in faithful remembrance of youth and blossoms
their honey-filled pots of gold.</p>

<p>It was at the noon hour that the two girls came to
pick up windfalls. They waded through the long grass
lamenting the great dark bruises on the soft pear
shapes.</p>

<p>"One smashing fall, and a whole lovely pear is
spoiled," complained Minga.</p>

<p>"Something like people," Sard thought; "one
bruise makes us say a pear is 'spoiled.' A person
does some one thing that isn't right, and then as it
has with Terence, it spreads out and out and we think
of him not as having his other good qualities, but of
just that one thing. Terence might have been a good
horse trainer or a good pianist or a ship's captain or
anything that needs recklessness and short swift purpose,
but he has done the one great awful thing that
blots out all those other qualities and that makes him
for all time just a murderer."</p>

<p>The girl thoughtfully stood, her head drooping and
her face deep with a curious shadow of tragedy that
was partly inherited. Sard felt sure that somewhere
in her ancestry were people who cared in some deep
way for humanity, who agonized and were sorry as she
was for all the sadness and madness of the world.
The thought comforted her. Now, as she picked up
pear after pear and caught sight of Colter kneeling,
busy putting ashes around the roots of blackberry
vines, she called to him.</p>

<p>"Are the blackberries ripening?"</p>

<p>Colter slowly rose. Minga, standing lost in a stare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of curiosity, saw the tall, straight, loosely-built figure
and finely modeled face with its thin and curiously
yearning line from cheek to jaw. The eyes of a hot
blue were very intense, and the curious backward
swath of deep chestnut hair made an unusual setting
for the chiseling of a face that, while it was still
young, was curiously marred with suffering, yet had
something of debonair quality that the girl was too immature
to analyze. Minga, hardly knowing why she
did so, looked at the hands closed easily on the garden
rake. Even to her crude perception they were disciplined
hands with the signs of other than coarse toil
upon them.</p>

<p>Colter, in answering the question, advanced toward
them. Both girls were conscious of the clean, trim
set effect of the working shirt on his well-built frame;
the tie was exact under his soft collar. His voice
when he spoke was low, with a weak, shaky emphasis,
but he answered Sard's question interestedly, "I think
these berries could be greatly improved. The vines
have grown full of dead wood. I've done a little cutting
away, and perhaps with better soil treatment,"
he nodded to the pears, "they're very fine just now.
Judge Bogart wants me to take a basket of them up
to Mrs. Ralling. She lives on the upper road, I
think."</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing so surely indicative of
certain training and breeding as the pronunciation of
proper names, particularly names that have R and L
in them. The foreigner in our country slurs these
letters with childlike confidence. The badly-bred per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>son,
ear untrained to niceties of speech, furs the R
and gobbles the L and chews his vowels. These are
the curious unconscious ways by which the American
shows his contempt of all distinguished nuances. Colter,
so the two young girls observed, did none of
these things. Neither did he employ the over-stressed
nicety, the too careful method of the person who has
not always spoken correctly. What he had to say he
said gently, half thoughtfully. He stood looking at
the girls without familiarity, but he showed no constraint.</p>

<p>"I found your book, Miss Bogart." Colter drew
the volume out of his coat hanging on a pear tree.</p>

<p>Sard reached eagerly for it. "Then I did leave it
out here!"</p>

<p>She turned to Minga. "I was reading it here the
day before you came&mdash;all this time in the grass, my
'Oxford Book of Verse,'" Sard, a true book-lover,
examined the little volume affectionately. "The
leaves don't seem to be hurt, and yet it rained two
nights ago." She looked at Colter. "You took care
of it?"</p>

<p>He smiled in a pleased sort of way. "It was pretty
well dampened, but I found a way to dry it without
streaking. I," he hesitated, "I know a little about the
treatment of wet paper." Colter looked off, knitting
his brows thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Minga, uninterested, was turning away, but the
gardener nodded at the book. "I've been reading
some things in there I like. I wonder if you would
let me have it a little longer?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>There was dignity in the man's voice, yet a curious
pleading note as if he asked to be allowed to hold on
to something very necessary to him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I once owned this book," he explained, then
stood seemingly plunged in thought, hardly noticing
the two girls who stared at him.</p>

<p>"Surely." Sard made her free gesture as she
handed him back the little volume. "Keep it as long
as you like," said the girl in friendly fashion, "and,
Colter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man paused, respectfully attentive.</p>

<p>"Don't you want some other things to read?"
Sard's eyes, friendly with interest, were upon him.
She was unconscious, sympathetic. "I know Father
would let you have anything in his library."</p>

<p>"I'll bet anything Judgie would not," was Minga's
inner comment.</p>

<p>A curious look came over the man's face. As he
stood there, the sunlight on the russet hair, there came
into his eyes a quality of pleasure and bright response,
of good will and courteous deference that was the unmistakable
look of personality. But it was momentary.
The two girls, young, not very well versed in
subtle shades of breeding, stood staring curiously at
him. Then suddenly they saw the look transform;
a dull expression, a sort of hunted suspicion settled
on the sensitive features; and it was only a garden
hand in baggy trousers and sun-faded gray shirt that
stood before them; something had faded out of the
man.</p>

<p>Faltering at the mystery of it, Sard tried to repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
her offer. "I meant," she said awkwardly, "you
seemed to care so for books."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Colter quietly. "I will leave
your book in the kitchen."</p>

<p>It was done with so final an air that there was
nothing for the girl to do but follow Minga out of
the orchard, but before she left the garden she raised
her eyes with a swift inquiring look into the strong
blue ones fixed upon her. What she saw there puzzled
and dismayed her. A sudden thought set her
heart to beating quickly. "Minga," called Sard suddenly,
"Minga, wait for me!" Startled like a bird,
the girl sped out of the little garden patch. The two
hurried toward the house.</p>

<p>Minga put her hand on Sard's shoulder; a look of
frank curiosity and inquiry was on her face. "Where
did he get that name Colter?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"It was printed in the old wreck of a cap he wore,
but he says it is not his name. But he can't remember
his name. Well," asked Sard breathlessly, "well,
what do you think?"</p>

<p>Minga faced the older girl solemnly. "Look here,"
she demanded, "what is that creature&mdash;who is it&mdash;where
did you pick it up?"</p>

<p>"Then you felt it, too," Sard demanded triumphantly.
"You know he isn't a common person?"</p>

<p>Minga shook her head solemnly. "I don't know
what I know," obstinately, "only it can't be the President
of the United States, you know, and it isn't any
kind of foreigner and yet&mdash;yet he seems to feel as if
he were some punkins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you do see it, too?" Sard was exultant.
She grasped the arm of the other girl. "Come on up
to my room in the tower and we can talk. Don't let
Aunt Reely join us."</p>

<p>"Are you girls making any arrangements for the
Saturday night club dance?" demanded that lady.
Miss Aurelia was fresh in a white dress with cuffs
and collar of intricate embroidery. She wore a chain
of colorless coral beads. "This dance will not be like
the others 'in sweaters and tennis shoes,'" she warned
them. "Mrs. Spoyd has been working very hard to
get the young people to appear well at the dances.
Now your frock, Sard, needs certain things done to
it. Mrs. Spoyd thinks you dress too old."</p>

<p>"Oh, gracious!" Sard threw out her hands in impatience.
"My yellow frock is good for a year yet.
Don't bother, dear," she begged.</p>

<p>"Now, Sard, I'm not sure," Miss Aurelia demurred.
"Last time you wore it I thought&mdash;they wear them so
short now. Shouldn't you take it up a little? But I
don't know. Of course, Mrs. Spoyd thinks&mdash;I&mdash;she&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;" Minga
interfered.</p>

<p>"Come in and look at my pretty little robe," she
invited sweetly. "Such a jazzy little affair! Straight
off the Avenue."</p>

<p>Minga held up a small bunch of color. "Perky,
isn't it?" she wanted to know. "A little daring, as
the lady said, but of course, if that's what people are
wearing&mdash;&mdash;" Minga made a face of sweet inquiry.</p>

<p>The twin-petaled blue tunic with its girdle and
shoulder straps of flame color had two jeweled butter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>flies,
one planted below Minga's little thin chest, the
other at the base of her supple back. This confection
could have been blown away with a sigh. Miss
Aurelia heaved that sigh.</p>

<p>"Of course, nowadays that cut under the arm is
what they all wear&mdash;very popular. Dearest," asked
Miss Aurelia plaintively, "if it should grow cold and
you wanted an&mdash;er&mdash;under body or guimpe of any
kind, I'm sure I could lend you one. And you wear
so little underneath&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Minga, holding the dress close up to her, hung her
dark curly head on one side. "Rather nippy," she
remarked with satisfaction. "You think it shows too
much of me? Oh, no," comforted Minga, "there's
really quite a good deal of me that doesn't show, but
don't worry, Miss Aurelia, nobody will be thinking
about that. People aren't as curious about how we're
made as they used to be. We all know that we've got
arms and legs and chests and shoulders and ribs and
things. It isn't interesting any more!"</p>

<p>Saying this Minga unwittingly put her finger on
what is half truth, that is, that it is the Puritanical
people of the world who emphasize the harm that is
done by vulgar thinking and dressing. The prudish
people think more about vulgarity than the vulgar
themselves. The way to kill such things is to ignore.
The fashion, when it has become a fashion, ceases to
be notable, or even challenging. But its dubious life
is prolonged by those who seek to curb it.</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia, with many murmured doubts and
misgivings, now took Sard's frock out of its tissue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
paper and pasteboard box. With it went a violet sash
and violet slippers that Minga scrutinized rather disparagingly.
"She ought to have scarlet slippers and
scarlet stockings with that yellow."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be good taste," said Sard shortly.</p>

<p>"But it would be noticed," replied her friend archly,
"and you have nice legs, Sard. Now, Aunt Reely,"
Minga held up an accusing finger, "don't pretend you
don't know that. You do know that Sard has nice
legs; so does Judgie, so does Dunstan. Why shouldn't
the world know?"</p>

<p>So the conference on evening dress broke up amid
Miss Aurelia's doubts and fears and distressed sense
of legs. Minga leading, the girls climbed the tower
room stairs, half restraining their giggles.</p>

<p>"If I come down to dinner in that frock Judgie will
send me to bed without my supper," Minga prophesied;
"just the same, he will take several long looks
to be sure he is right." The restless tongue wagged
on until Minga became conscious that her comrade
was not listening to her. She glanced at Sard staring
out of the window and remembered what they had
climbed up here for. "Now tell me about this queer
critter you've got out there. You call him Colter. I'd
have been willing to bet my engagement ring that was
not his real name. His real name," said Minga, "is
Lancelot Humbug."</p>

<p>Sard, twisting the shade cord, slowly shook her
head. "How do we know?" she murmured. "He isn't
anything we think he is. I mean what he's supposed
to be, but," she looked quickly at Minga, then away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
"I've come to the point where I'd rather not know
anything. There might be something awful." The
girl shivered slightly. "How do I know?" she repeated.</p>

<p>Sard turned eagerly to her friend. "Minga, do you
get things, have them come to you, without thinking?
Do you ever just know things through and
through without being told, you know, sort of sense
a thing?"</p>

<p>Minga, going to the dressing-table and taking the
ivory-backed nail buffer, searched about for some
polishing powder. "When you start off like that,"
the girl remarked, "I always find some light hand
labor. Go on, Sard, honey; I can get my nails beautifully
done while you give me the last Sard-slush."</p>

<p>"Oh, you fuss so over your nails," said the other
girl irritably. "I think it's bad taste, somehow. I
can't bear these women who take every moment they
get to compare their hair and teeth and nails and
fingers; there's something monkey-like about it, sort
of like savages. I suppose," Sard laughed a little
ironically, "if I had nothing else to do but sit on the
sand and smear oil on my skin I'd be interested in
such things, too."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Minga imperturbably, "you
are all rubbed up! You foam, you fairly sizzle!"
She went over to her friend and archly explained.</p>

<p>"It's only my sweet womanly concern for my lover&mdash;dearrrest&mdash;Tawny
has telephoned; only engaged six
dances. I think he's slipping away from me, and I
don't want to lose him, not when they're doing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
queer 'bubble and squeak step' and he's the only
man who can do it. Tawny," explained Minga, "must
see his ring glittering upon the most feminine little
hand in the world. You see I have a feeling that he
wants to pass me up for Cynthia or Gertrude; these
two have been corresponding with him, and he sent
them candy last week&mdash;<i>Blaaaaaa!</i>"</p>

<p>Minga, with a gesture of disgust, dropped her eyes.
She waved her buffer in the air, fastening her eyes on
her friend. "Does he think he can fool me that
way? Ahem, I'm talking." The other girl's head was
turned away, the eyes staring in troubled fixity at the
river. "If anyone were to fall out of the hearse and
ask me," said Minga with tender solemnity, "I should
reply that I did not think you were interested."</p>

<p>It was the quality of essential good nature in this
girl that made her loved. All Minga's idle words, her
flippancies and inconsistencies seemed to conceal some
sound core of being that made her not willing to
wound. Now, she went over and brought her hand
down on Sard's back.</p>

<p>"Minga!" The other started irritably and edged
away.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" said the little person with bobbed
hair. "Sard, don't be silly; you act like Mannikin
Maude, the Temperamental Tempest. Now in good,
plain American what's the matter?" Minga, turning
her friend's head to meet her eyes, pronounced her
verdict.</p>

<p>"Say, look here, you've&mdash;you've been no good since
that night on the mountain with Watts Shipman; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
snubbed you, I suppose, the way he snubbed us all.
Well, what do you care? He's only a silly old bachelor.
Pooh!" Minga addressed her finger nails, "I
could eat into his heart like a maggot if I only wanted
to&mdash;&mdash;" She slapped Sard on the back again.
"Ooooo&mdash;but you're gloomy. Brace up, cheer up,
swell up, the worst is yet to come!"</p>

<p>No one could withstand this absurd rallying. The
girl at the window smiled in spite of herself, but she
shook her head.</p>

<p>"Minga," in a low voice, "that man out there is
somebody!"</p>

<p>"Bllllaaaaa." Minga rolled in despairing disapprobation
on the couch. "I know it, but it's not my affair.
I knew that was what was going on in your
head. Lawrence Multimillionaire, the missing heir of
Deepcroft Manor&mdash;Oh!" Minga wailed, "to think of
you, Sard, the steady, the highbrow, the blessed Damosel,
to come to a thing like this! Honest, I do think
the movies turn our heads when&mdash;when we least expect
it. I thought I noticed that the garbage man
wore a fraternity pin," she jeered, "and surely the
iceman quoted from the 'Rubaiyat' yesterday morning."</p>

<p>But Sard would not catch at this mood, she only
put aside the teasing hand that tweaked her hair and
fussed over her belt buckle. At last, she said half
under her breath, "If it is amnesia, if he himself
doesn't know who he is, where he belongs, think of
the horror of that!"</p>

<p>There was a whir and chug of an arrested car on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the drive under the window. Dunstan with klaxon
and voice hailed them. "Oh, you Minga, put out your
head. Say, goils, we've got a notion. The Gertrude
bunch is going to pull off that canoe trip up the Hackensack
River this afternoon&mdash;supper and a few ghost
stories, toasted marshmallows, wit, laughter, and
moonlight. Want to go?"</p>

<p>Minga looked out, eyeing him critically. "Dunce,
why do you wear a sweater that color? It's awful for
you; you should wear nothing but soft tans and yellow
to go with your doggy eyes."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Dunstan, "that'll do for my doggy
eyes." He got out and went around to the back of
the car and took out a kit of tools. "Now I don't
want to be bothered with the drool of an engaged
flapper," he declared; "but I say, do you want to go
on this joy jump? I mean it."</p>

<p>The girls leaning out consulted each other with
their eyes. "We were going to wash our hair," demurred
Sard, "and then we promised to make fudge
for Aunt Reely, and then," said Minga solemnly,
"I promised to show Aunt Reely a knitting
stitch."</p>

<p>"Ha," the youth below looked up and grinned&mdash;"in
other words you don't want to go, or in still
other words you don't like the Gertrude and Cin
combination. Oh, Sard, you're so noble and literary,"
the brother said in mock admiration, "you express
things so well. You&mdash;she&mdash;I&mdash;they&mdash;it&mdash;he&mdash;she,"
Dunstan dropped the rôle of Aunt Aurelia and concluded
shortly, "Well, why should you go? Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
wants a couple of old hens washing their hair? The
road-hog Gert and Cin'll do all right."</p>

<p>Minga thought the thing over. "There's nothing to
see on the Hackensack," she misdoubted, "just old
water and moss and trees and things."</p>

<p>"Oh, ain't there?" said Dunstan, airily. "Well, I
don't tell everything to ladies who don't care for my
society or my friends. I don't speak of pink pearls,
and here I raced all the way home and punctured a
tire to get you two old crones because I thought you'd
like to go."</p>

<p>The two crones, slightly crestfallen, once more surveyed
each other.</p>

<p>"Which men did you pick out for us?" at last
inquired Sard.</p>

<p>Dunstan pushed back his cap; his brow was hot
with his philanthropic offer to promote a picnic.</p>

<p>"Well," he divulged, a little unwillingly, "of
course, Gertrude wanted me, and Cinny had a chap
coming out on an afternoon train, dunno who, and
then we thought, well, the girls thought, that Sperry,
the owl-eyed lawyer, would do for you, Sard, and
Minga, well, Balky Popham sort of butted in and
chose Minga."</p>

<p>"That settles it, you see." Minga grinned politely
with all her little teeth. "We're going to wash our
hair!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my faith!" groaned the youth below. "Say,
you two are a couple of Convent Coolies." Looking up
wrath fully he tried to face them down with this
epithet, but to face a person down while looking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>ward
is difficult: at last he gave it up. "Right-o!" he
said bitterly. "Right-o! Then I get the fair Cynthia
with her little bag of dope and Gertrude with her
gloomy gaze, and we side-track the others and pass
on to our own private funeral."</p>

<p>There was something in the young fellow's tone as
he said this that roused both girls; half protesting,
half laughing, they leaned out. "No, wait, Dunce!"
they pleaded, "let's talk it over. Perhaps&mdash;wait&mdash;Dunce&mdash;Dunce&mdash;&mdash;"
but there was the angry whir of
the car and Dunce was gone.</p>

<p>Minga's face was scarlet, her eyes gleamed. She
turned to Sard. "Well, now you see what we've done.
We were idiots. He was asking us because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;Sard,
you know what those girls are!"</p>

<p>Sard, brows knitted, was self-conscious. "I ought
to have realized," she said slowly, "but perhaps it's
just&mdash;&mdash;Oh, dear, Minga, what were we thinking
of? Dunstan has done his best to sort of good-naturedly
keep away from Cinny and Gertrude! My,
she's horrible for a nice boy."</p>

<p>"And they'll work up a stag line with him for to-morrow
night," said Minga. "Oh, oh, oh!" she
stamped her foot. "They'll have the pick of the
dances and all the extras. You know how they'll
work it, Sard. Why didn't you think quickly?"</p>

<p>The other girl ran her hand lovingly over the curly
head. "Such a little pepper-pot; why didn't you
think? I thought you didn't want to go, Minga; you're
so funny, nobody will ever know what you want."</p>

<p>"Well, I will," asserted Minga vehemently, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
is, I'll know what I want when I want it and now I
want everlastingly to keep that Gertrude thing from
our nice boys and from Tawny, don't you see, Sard?"
Minga's eyes widened virtuously. "She's setting
traps for my fiancé."</p>

<p>Sard threw back her head. "Oh," she pealed, "oh,
you are too dreadful. I give you up. Come on down
to lunch."</p>

<p>The luncheon gong sounded its three soft ascending
vibrations. The girls, consulting, went down arm-in-arm.
At the table they talked of the large chrysanthemums
they had seen at a flower show and of a
new way to serve butter, and Aunt Aurelia thought,
"I am so glad to see them getting interested in ladylike
things. It is fortunate they did not go on with
college; they have just enough ideas, I think."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class="center">PINK PEARLS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">People</span> who like to dream geologic dreams of the
figures and forms that moved in the long night of
ancient Chaos are fond of tracing out some connection
between the Hudson River and its neighbor, the
woodland winding Hackensack. Not much narrower
than the Tiber, and certainly wider than the little
trickles that are left of the classic rivers of Greece,
it has little personality for the general inhabitants of
New York or New Jersey. Only to those who make
friends of the hidden and search out the obscure is
revealed the romance of the little river. The Hudson,
grown conventional and well turned out, like a handsome
mother, accustomed to hotel life, has a daughter,
always at her side, yet elusive and wayward. These
two, separated by mountain walls and palisade doors
and lovely stretches of dreaming hills, meadows and
road-crossed flats, have some common secret origin
that they cannot alter nor disguise.</p>

<p>The nobler river is, however, destined to become
the Path of Commerce, the trail of the great white
Foot of Civilization, while the little Hackensack,
punctuated here and there with history of the
Colonials and with midnight escapes and sorties,
winding by old sandstone houses with ancient roofs,
still keeps reticence, a lovely inaccessibility. Screened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
by maples, green hemlocks and alders in some haunts,
in others she is a broad tranquil sheet of green crystal
or a copper sunset path that leads into vine-hung
bowers or spreads out into bare flats where the reeds
rear tasseled heads.</p>

<p>Here the blue herons keep their silent vigils, the
eagles have nests; here the muskrats drag blue mussel
shells along the mossy banks and scatter the tiny pink
pearls that sometimes reward hunters, who follow the
azure iridescence. The cardinal flower and blue
gentian blaze their quiet little trails along the sedges
and Indian pipe glimmers in the back thicket.
Pitcher plant and sundew, a thousand tiny lanterns
of multi-colored berries, all the lush tenting and blossomy
fragrance of grapes and hazelnut, and a hundred
secret water plants&mdash;these are the things that go
on living, where the birds bathe and the snakes lie
languid and the turtles meet for their boggy conferences.</p>

<p>Sard's plan was to make the trip up the Hackensack
by themselves. After lunch she stole out to the
garage to find Colter, who was washing the depot
car.</p>

<p>"Anyone using this this afternoon?" Sard indicated
the long black body.</p>

<p>The man paused. He shut off the hose. "I think
not. Judge Bogart has gone off with a friend for golf;
Mr. Dunce took the roadster." There were invariably
long pauses between Colter's sentences. "You wish
to use it?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Sard thought a moment. "We want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
join Mr. Dunstan's party up the Hackensack. You
spoke of having been up that stream once, and said
you knew where we could get a canoe. Would you,
could you take us up?"</p>

<p>Squeezing out a sponge, Colter stood there without
answering. He looked at the dripping sponge so
dazedly that Sard thought he had not heard. "You
know how to manage a canoe?" she asked. "We
could get along with one boat, going up-stream toward
the big race above West Morris. Why, Colter,
what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Going up-stream in a boat," repeated Colter
thickly. "That's all over; going up a woodland
stream in a boat. No&mdash;coming down&mdash;with him&mdash;dead!"
The man did not look at her. "Where&mdash;where
was it?" he asked. He stood clenching his
hands, his eyes staring; he turned, not seeing the girl,
though his deep fire-blue eyes burnt into hers.
"Where was it?" he asked tensely.</p>

<p>The thing was so strange in its utter irrelevance
that Sard, though she had seen him like this before,
could hardly keep from rubbing her eyes. As in a
dream she saw Colter's hand go out; it was as if he
tried to push something away. "A boat," he muttered,
"a boat and a stream that was walled with
vines. Wait&mdash;wait!" He breathed rapidly, his head
lifted as if he desperately tried to recall something;
then he suddenly turned his eyes on the girl, shook
his head and groaned. He passed his hand over his
eyes and looked at her, smiling very gently.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get it," he said simply, half apologetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>ally;
"sometimes a little of it comes in parts. Did I
startle you?" he asked with a look of concern.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;" she stammered. He had been like
that the day she had found him sitting with his feet
in the gutter muttering to himself. She waited with
self-possession that surprised her, then asked quietly,
"Was it something you wanted to tell me, something
that you remembered?"</p>

<p>The man looked at her, his eyes now clear and
rational. "No," gently, "I did not remember. You
see that is my trouble, I do not know. I can remember
nothing, nothing connected, not even who I
am."</p>

<p>"You do not know who you are?" asked the girl
awed. "Isn't there a book or a watch or something
with your name?"</p>

<p>But he seemed not to hear her. He stood there
lost in thought; finally, with a sigh, he seemed to give
it up and turned to her. "What time shall I have the
car around, Miss Bogart?"</p>

<p>"At four." The girl watched him for a moment
and she said, "We wanted you to go with us. We
wanted you to take charge of the expedition." She
was a little uncertain.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Miss Sard." Colter said it gravely,
cheerfully, with the machine-like acquiescence of the
trained gardener or chauffeur. Sard turned and
walked away, and he as quietly went back to his
work, but through the young being, in that strange
phase of a woman's mind and body that we call "intuition,"
went the baffling cadence of a man's voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
a cadence of doubt, terror and then the patient and
controlled, "Very well, Miss Sard."</p>

<p>Something of tradition in the girl tried to drown
it. Dismayed, she realized how this thing possessed
her, how this voice rang in her physical being,
"Very well, Miss Sard." She drew herself up. Was
she, then, a woman of birth, a girl of two years' college
training to be affected by the mere voice of a
vagabond, a tramp, an unshaven ne'er-do-well?</p>

<p>As the two girls got into their camping things, Sard
outlined the afternoon's programme. "And I want
to suggest&mdash;let's see what you think&mdash;I don't suppose
we should treat Colter quite like a common person;
well, one can see that he's not exactly a man
of all work."</p>

<p>Minga pinned back the flap of her scarlet tam-o'-shanter.
"It would be improper to treat him otherwise,"
Minga decided with what for her was rather
austere decision. "He isn't common exactly, but
queer, and that's worse; Sard," went on Minga with
an air of superiority, "I don't see how you could
have picked him up like that and carted him in your
nice clean car to that boarding-house place; Dunce
says you all but helped carry him and gave directions
and all&mdash;Ugh&mdash;and then lied to your father, pretending
all this about a common workman."</p>

<p>Sard's face darkened. "I didn't lie," she said in a
low voice. "I picked him up because I had seen him
there sitting, hour after hour, with that queer dazed
look, so wretched, shaken and awful. I'll admit he
looked dreadful, but somehow his eyes didn't look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
dirty; something that was awfully clean spoke
through all his wretchedness, and when I heard him
tell those stupid policemen that he 'couldn't remember,'
his voice got to me&mdash;got to me&mdash;&mdash;" Sard
restlessly wandered about the room unable to express
what she meant. "I suddenly felt that I, well, I
knew him, and," announced the girl defiantly, "I've
somehow felt that way ever since. I just knew. I
admit it's queer, Minga."</p>

<p>"It's queer, all right," Minga said succinctly, "and
so are you." She stuck her scarf inside her boyish
little jacket and struck an attitude in her boots and
knickerbockers.</p>

<p>"Fluffy Fiddlestick, the film heroine, is now going
to give the Hackensack the once-over," she announced.
"Talk about screen stuff; all this that you say about
this tramp man, Sard, is worse than any screen story
I ever saw, and you so demure! It isn't lying, but
it's letting things lie for you; you got that bank person
at Morris to suggest Colter to Judgie. Does Aunt
Reely know you're responsible for his being here?
A regular Gentleman John, and nobody but you in
the secret." Minga, with quite an injured air, picked
up her wrist-watch and fastened it on; she eyed herself
in the mirror. "Do I need lipstick, no? Would
the turtles appreciate red lips?"</p>

<p>"Well, you do know he's not a common man?"
Sard asked, obstinately.</p>

<p>"Mercy, I don't know anything," retreated Minga
easily. "Now, how do we get by Auntie's bower in
these knickers?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>As they slipped together down the back stairs, Sard
chuckled. "The funny part of it is Aunt Reely is
reconciled to knickers; so is that queer Mrs. Spoyd.
You see, they know that the English countesses and
princesses wear them, and they sit studying all the
different women's knickers in the fashion sheets and
secretly wonder if they couldn't wear them themselves.
I heard Mrs. Spoyd say, dreamingly, 'Well,
my dearrrrr, I suppose we shall soon have stylish
Stouts in the&mdash;er&mdash;camping trousers also,' and Aunt
Reely sighed, 'We must try to adapt ourselves.'
They are getting to be very popular!"</p>

<p>The girls went giggling down the steps and out the
kitchen way, Sard glancing at the kitchen clock. "We
ought to be able to get up-stream before Dunce and
his party; they're starting way down-stream back of
Spencerville. I'm going to embark above the West
Morris station; here's supper and the tea basket, and
I've told Maggie and Dora to have something hot in
case we come in late."</p>

<p>It was like college days, like bacon bats and beach
parties and Saturday hikes, and the girls' spirits rose.
They bowed brightly to Colter, appearing with the
depot car. In some way the man, clean and shaven,
long limbed, clad neatly in faded old shirt and khaki
trousers with dark tie carefully tied, was not a disagreeable
figure as he gathered up the luncheon things
and thermos bottles and waited for Sard's signal.
The girl herself took the wheel, and Minga perched
beside her. The novelty of the thing worked on the
restless mind of the girl under the scarlet tam-o'-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>shanter.
"Wait till Cinny sees this," Minga murmured
nervously, "and&mdash;and Gertrude! How'll they
take the Colter addition to a party&mdash;he really looks all
right, doesn't he? Those queer clothes set right, and
his hair is brushed back like other people's, and his
hands look good and kind, somehow. How old do
you suppose he is?" she whispered. "About twice as
old as Dunce?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Sard turned a sharp corner carefully.
"About thirty-seven, maybe forty." The eyes of both
the girls widened at this antique possibility, but Sard
remembered that there had been a professor at college
who had seemed like a boy, almost as young as Dunce,
and he was thirty-five.</p>

<p>There was a curious lift in Sard's head, in her eyes
a flying look of adventure; her figure, light, alert, sat
at the steering gear with a look of power and repose;
her wistful profile had lines that were resolute
and composed, as if waiting for some stuff of life on
which to try their power; all about her in the windy
press of their speed was the buoyant look of physical
action, green trees, brown vital roads like veins full
of the blood of Wanderlust and adventure; like them,
the girl was ardent, fresh, a thing pure and intense as
fire, yet sober and clean as water. In her belted coat
and rough hat and the flying strands of hair, she drove
in confident direction, over the damp woodland roads,
over the swamps and bridges of the Morris turnpike,
a very figure of Advance, so thought a man, who
stood to let them pass, then let his arm fly up in hasty
flourish. "Winged Victory!" he breathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello!" Watts' hand flew to his hat and he
waved it; then as the girls, with friendly greeting,
slowed down, he turned back to parley. "Hold up
your hands," he ordered gruffly. "Give me your wristwatches;
no quarter."</p>

<p>It was all part of their feeling of quest and adventure,
and they liked the tall lawyer for the little
highway gesture as he stood there, his face lined with
dust and sunburn, his costume showing rents and
wrinkles of cross-country walking. The two wideawake
faces smiled at him as he glanced tentatively
at the gray-clad figure at the back of the car, but there
was no introduction, though the lawyer paused for it.
The man sitting there did not turn, but had a quiet
position of relaxation. Sard reddened slightly.</p>

<p>"We're off on a lark," they explained. "Have you
seen Dunce and his gang? We hope we've stolen a
march on them; we're further up the river, we
think."</p>

<p>"Going for some of those little pink pearls," explained
Minga, "and we want to get ahead of 'em."</p>

<p>Shipman's amused eyes ran over the outfit. The
excited girls, the silent man with tea basket and the
thermos bottles; he looked sympathetic.</p>

<p>"Little pink pearls?" eyeing Minga teasingly,
"are you going to pick them off the trees, or take
them out of the turtles' mouths? How much food
have you there, anything substantial?"</p>

<p>"Loads," they assured him; "we're stocked up for
the Bible multitude; we have loaves and fishes and
everything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Still the older man hesitated. It was a little audacious,
but he tried his luck at playing "young."</p>

<p>"Take me with you?" glancing at the averted
face of Colter and questioningly raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>The two girls accepted his self-invitation gaily.
"Take you, won't we though? We need another
man." Sard glanced back at the figure in the back.
"This is Colter, whom we brought to help us with the
boat and all that; he knows the Hackensack."</p>

<p>Watts Shipman nodded in his usual friendly way,
and Minga, wide-eyed, observed that Colter's recognition
was of the same order, a quiet, courteous friendliness.
The little figure in the scarlet cap leaned eagerly
toward the famous lawyer. Shipman and
Minga seemed on surprisingly good terms. Purposely
the lawyer kept any memory of their last encounter
out of his manner and eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you really know where the pink pearls are?"</p>

<p>For answer Watts, standing in the road, took a
little phial from his pocket and displayed it. On a bed
of cotton were four or five tiny seed pearls of cream
color and soft rose. The two girls opened their eyes
with delight.</p>

<p>"Goodness," the worldly Minga was impressed.
"Why don't Tiffany or somebody come up and get
these? There might be a fortune in the Hackensack."</p>

<p>"They've had men up here," interposed Colter
quietly, "but there wasn't enough in it for them."</p>

<p>The party turned and looked at him questioningly;
Colter took the phial Shipman handed him. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
see, they never grow very large," he explained, examining
a pearl that rolled into his hand. "There is some
substance lacking, but whatever it is, the reason isn't
known, I think."</p>

<p>"Just the same, it will be fun to hunt for them."
Shipman was as eager as a boy. "I have an extra
skiff at that little house you see by the bridge up
yonder; suppose I bring that; we can have a flotilla,"
he nodded to Colter, who nodded back.</p>

<p>"Surely," he agreed.</p>

<p>The voice, courteous of inflection, assured in enunciation,
arrested the lawyer's attention as it had arrested
Sard's. As the girls slipped to the ground,
moving about the car, captivating in their trim camping
costumes, the lawyer, his eye taking in their assured
grace, the lithe precision of their movements,
swept a curious eye over their companion.</p>

<p>The newly-shaven chin, the dark red hair brushed
back and hands with nails that had once been well-shaped
and cared for, mystified him with the sense
of hidden identity, and yet he got no sense of purposeful
concealment. Somehow the man seemed like
a person who moved in a dream; what he said and
did was done automatically, as if the Self had no
abiding interest in his activities. The lawyer was
conscious of a certain sense of mystery as he turned to
assist with the tea basket and things.</p>

<p>"Can I help?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, if you'll bear a hand with those bottles."
As Shipman grasped the things held out to him he
looked for a moment full into the other's eyes, eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
that met his quite quietly, too, but with an awful look
of question.</p>

<p>"I am a gentleman," said those eyes&mdash;"do you
know me, have you ever seen me&mdash;<i>who am I?"</i></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class="center">REVELATIONS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two skiffs, now paddled, now poled, glided
along the green-bronze waters of the woodland shores;
the girls, sitting in the stern, were silent, this partly
from Shipman's suggestion. Minga had started her
customary chatter, but the lawyer laid his big hand
on her shoulder. She looked up to find him, finger
on lips, dark eyes smiling into hers. "If you want to
see things," he whispered, "you'll have to be as dumb
as a silent policeman." Minga, remembering the night
on South Mountain, gave a slight involuntary shiver
which the man noticed.</p>

<p>"Child!" exclaimed Shipman suddenly. He
looked long and intently into the little face; he must
have seen something rare like the blue shell of an
eager little soul-bird, a little shell that must not be
broken too roughly. "Forgive me for everything,"
he said contritely; "you must think me an awful sort
of brute. Talk as much as you like, you rosebud. I
only meant, well, there are things to see if one is
quiet, you know!"</p>

<p>Minga smiled back into his face. It was an uncertain
little smile, shorn of her usual gay sparkle and
challenge or the repartee of what was known as "the
Minga line." Seeing this, the lawyer removed his
hand from her shoulder quickly; he reached for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
pipe and tobacco and lighted up for his abstemious
afternoon smoke. Minga idly watched his deliberate
movements, the curious impression that he gave of
inherent remorseless power, of so physical and
dynamic a kind fed by so enormous a reservoir of
understanding and self-control that the girl might well
feel in awe of it.</p>

<p>Paddle in hand, Shipman stood in the bow of the
boat. He dug softly into the deep flow of the water;
they turned the slow curve of an island, rounding
afresh into long avenues of alders and elderberry and
toward the purple gloom of hanging swamp maples.
Colter's boat, Sard leaning eagerly forward, followed.
Now and then the two men would halt and point to
some half distinguished object, a great gray hornet's
nest whorled like a ball of paper cinders in the thicket,
a blue heron standing motionless, a mud hen sitting
heavily in a dead tree. The long line of empty mussel
shells was strung like big beads over the cushions of
soft moss; a muskrat swam across the stream; a chipmunk,
sitting on his haunches and munching like a
cooky, a dark-brown mushroom&mdash;here and there clusters
of scarlet amanita, yellow fungus like sponges, the
delicate hanging Clintonia bells, or a thousand filmy
patches of moss, where little trumpets blew and coral
lights glowed, and little banners and transparencies
marked the tiny march of plant progress.</p>

<p>Colter, steadily sculling his flat-bottomed craft,
looked with evident delight on these things&mdash;his gaunt
form stood steadily on its long legs, there was determined,
practiced deliberation in his movements and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
his were the eyes that first discovered this and that
rarity. The intense gaze of the man seemed
to burn into the dim forest walls of summer, his ears
caught every subdued note, he peered like a sort of
necromancer at a spider web, at a snail lethargically
climbing the mud bank or a patch of sun dew, all its
little gummy tentacles alert for fly-capture.</p>

<p>Minga, turning once, heard him mutter something
under his breath; she stole a startled glance at him as
her own boat sped along, and leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Don't go too fast, we mustn't get too far ahead
of Sard; I don't like to leave her alone with that&mdash;that
man."</p>

<p>Shipman raised his eyebrows. "Why," using her
undertones, "isn't he the chauffeur? He's all right,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>Minga was mysterious; a curious womanly accent
of responsibility sat strangely on this little figure, with
pretty legs in trim knickerbockers and puttees, and
dark head of bobbed hair.</p>

<p>"He's just plain queer," objected Minga. "You'd
never guess that the Judge and Miss Reely know
nothing about him; that man, you see, is one of
Sard's pickups."</p>

<p>"Pickups." Shipman frowned, while he smiled.</p>

<p>Minga luxuriated in the irregularity of the thing.
"Oh," she protested, "you may think you know Sard,
but you don't&mdash;nobody," said Minga solemnly,
"knows her as I do. Of course," the little bobbed
head shook wisely, "Sard wouldn't do anything&mdash;er&mdash;well,
you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Shipman tried to control his humor. "Of course
not," he echoed.</p>

<p>"Just the same," Minga was dramatic, "she goes
around picking up queer people and sick dogs and
babies and spending her money on them and getting
them into hospitals and oh, awful things," said Minga,
darkly. "She knows girls that haven't husbands and
well&mdash;&mdash;" she gave a gesture which though vague was
eloquent.</p>

<p>The lawyer led her on. "So Miss Sard picked up
this vagabond."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe not a vagabond," Minga looked over
her shoulder warily, "a tramp, sort of, and he might
be crazy. I heard him," she went on mysteriously,
"use Latin words a moment ago and then look around,
oh, so strangely."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," Shipman, with equal solemnity,
nodded; "anyone who uses Latin or Greek these days
is mad, of course; but it's a divine madness. I use
it myself. I'm a little mad, you know." He bent
amused eyes on his companion. "How did you know
it was Latin?"</p>

<p>Minga looked back a little exultantly; the coquette
in her never very far away from the surface, rose to
his teasing. "I know some," announced this young
person with a toss; "for instance," Minga became
rather glib at the game they were playing, this was
her "line," "I know all the conjugations of the
verb 'amo.'"</p>

<p>"Well done," said Shipman idly. He smiled perfunctorily,
but the great lawyer did not seem par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>ticularly
anxious to take up this gay little gauntlet; he
was thoughtful, prodding the creek water rather
viciously. "You think Colter might be a college man
in disguise," he said abruptly, "wandering around
studying sociological problems, no? That sort of
thing is a fad these days, isn't it?" Just then Sard
hailed them.</p>

<p>"I hear the Gertrude-bunch down-stream," she
called in laughing triumph. "We've beat them to it;
that's Dunce's queer yelp. Now," said the girl
briskly, "suppose we get out on the shores of this
big 'race' ahead here and make a fire and have our
supper and wait until they turn up, then we can give
them coffee, and we can all go down-stream in a procession
and slam home in the machines together."</p>

<p>Minga nodded approvingly; the youngster had been
a little overawed by the society of a man so much
older than herself; now the prospect of a few young
howlers and slangers of her own set revived her.
"The very thing," she said. At the same time Minga
realized that it would impress Gertrude and Cinny to
see her being propelled in a skiff by the well-known
barrister, Watts Shipman. All her funny little appreciations
of life were concentrated upon keeping Shipman
apparently her slave until these ladies should appear.
They would think him awfully old, of course,
but then, he was a famous lawyer and "popular,"
or as Minga construed him, "important," and that
would be good for Gertrude and Cinny. The small
intriguer waited in a highly feminine manner for
Shipman to assist her out of the skiff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly there was an exclamation from Colter,
who had found a large mussel hanging on a half-submerged
tree trunk. He methodically opened it with
his knife and had just cut out from the jelly-like
substance within a smooth oval as big as a grain of
barley. "A beauty," breathed Colter, as he bent
soberly down to the water to wash it. The group
watched him take a bit of chamois from his pocket
and polish it; somehow Sard was not surprised to see
the long sensitive hand go into another pocket and
produce a magnifying glass. The girl, who had been
watching him gravely, felt a curious exultation that
the other man should see her protégé so detached and
calm in his movements. She looked curiously into his
face, noting with a kind of pang, a wonder, all the
lines of sweetness and self-control, laid over with a
strange patience. She felt triumphant&mdash;suddenly Colter
turned toward her, and with a little bow, put in her
hand the little misshapen pearl. "A shape like folded
light, embodied air," he murmured.</p>

<p>Sard stared. "Why, that is Emerson." Then wonderingly,
"You read that in my little book?"</p>

<p>He smiled. Colter's smile was pleasant, with a row
of not too regular, but very white teeth. "I used to
know it by heart," he confessed; he seemed to forget
Shipman and Minga, standing there observing. Once
more the strange look came over his face, and he said
rather eagerly, "For a time it seemed to open a door,
but I&mdash;&mdash;" Suddenly the man turned sharply, so
sharply that the girl was startled. "Where was that?"
he demanded thickly. "When did it happen? What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
was it that made my head cloud and the long illness?
Who was I before that? Where was I then?"</p>

<p>With a furious blush he shook his head as though
to shake off a fatal spell; he turned to Shipman and
Minga. "I&mdash;I beg your pardon; I shouldn't have
spoken. It comes over me like that; I forgot for the
moment."</p>

<p>Watts Shipman stood strangely quiet. The lawyer's
look was that of a man who himself gropes for a
clue and yet is suspicious. "But, yes," he said quietly,
not without a slight touch of patronage, "if there is
anything you want to straighten out, speak out, don't
be afraid of us."</p>

<p>But Colter groaned. His look first of horror was
altered to that of great mental struggle. The hands
clenching at his side, the fine face blunted and torn
by some doubt and fear; it was all too much for the
girl who had rescued him. Sard started toward him;
she put out her hand as to protect. "Hush!" she
said, "you must not try to remember;" then, soothingly,
"try to keep your mind just where it is now.
Here! With us!"</p>

<p>The man turned slowly toward her; he straightened
up obediently, looking from face to face, then all
around the scene where they stood; the clear "race"
murmuring about them, the little sandy shore, the
tea baskets and shawls tumbled on the ground; he
passed his hand over his face and, half-groaning, a
baffled expression as of a half-formed word broke
from his lips. "Did I frighten you?" he asked piteously.
"I am afraid I frightened you. I&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
was&mdash;&mdash;" He groaned, and it was a groan like human
tears.</p>

<p>Sard, who was trembling now in every limb, denied
it stoutly, but Minga looked resentful and suspicious.
The older girl who had originally guessed what was
the matter with Colter, that complete forgetfulness
had swept his mind blank of vital things, felt her
own sense of dismay. That the man was not playing
at this thing, that he had altogether lost his sense of
personal identity, she was sure, but back of that, what
lay back of that? Then with a hot shame she remembered
the tenderness that had come into her
voice as she said, "Hush," to this man; as if she had
spoken to a child.</p>

<p>But now the voices down the river were coming
closer. There was much far-off shouting and singing
in unfinished snatches of songs; the sound of a ukulele
and a mandolin played, the one with tripping assured
fingers, the other very much out of tune with clumsy
effort to produce harmonies. The staccato chatter
and gabble of two girl voices sounded oddly in the
dense woods of swamp maple; now and then shrill
laughter or an artificial scream jarred on the ears of
the up-stream party. Minga, still absorbed in her
search for possible pearls, hardly noticed this, but
Shipman, with a face as immovable as an Indian's,
gave it some inquiry.</p>

<p>"Who are in your brother's party?" he asked at
last. "Our friend Dunce of the repartee and&mdash;er&mdash;who
else?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cynthia Bradon," Minga returned, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Gertrude, the girl we call the 'road hog,' you know.
She's about the most modern girl I know," said
Minga with an air of congratulation; "nothing stops
her&mdash;she's sort of impulsive, you know, and yet crafty;
it's quite a queer combination."</p>

<p>Shipman thought it might be a very queer combination.
"There's a whopper, that mussel down
there," he bared his hairy arm and reached down for
it. "Looks as if there might be a whole pearl necklace
in that."</p>

<p>But when they cut it open the pearl was too small to
be of much account, so they scooped about in the
dark water for others. As they worked, Minga poured
out a good deal about Cynthia and Gertrude. The
lively scarlet-capped girl had forgotten how all the
way down South Mountain that night she had sworn
to Dunstan that she hated Shipman and had called
him a murderer and a man who would for sheer joy
commit Terence O'Brien and any other fugitive to
the electric chair for the glee of watching him done
to death. Now, on her knees, she turned her sparkling
blue eyes on the lawyer's dark face; they rested
there like flowers magnetized by the deep stream of
his being.</p>

<p>"If you get a big pearl like Sard's, I'll love you&mdash;all
my life," she said softly. Minga was trying the
little iridescent antennæ with which a woman tests
the toughness of a man's surface, but something genuine
stirred in her, and when the great lawyer turned
to look more closely into her face she had the grace
to wince a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's an engagement ring you wear, isn't it?"
Watts asked cheerfully. "Some nice little cub spending
his lunch money on flowers and candy for you."</p>

<p>Minga tried to blush, but the time-honored suffusion
somehow would not work; the girl's own consciousness,
her involuntary registry as of something
"wrong with the mechanism" did not escape the lawyer;
he threw back his head and the forest rang with
his glee.</p>

<p>"No, that's something you've lost, you modern
girls, you don't know how to blush. It was a wonderful
thing your mothers laid up just the way they
used to store up old wine, and it worked. Ye Gods!
how it worked! But you&mdash;a little bit too much soul-enamel,
Mademoiselle, to say nothing of these other
things you put on your lovely little faces."</p>

<p>Minga bent her head; if she couldn't blush she
could, at least, simulate shyness, and girls who hope
to be moving-picture actresses know how to simulate
most things; many of them are perfectly satisfied with
simulation for reality. Shipman went on teasing about
the engagement ring. "Tawny Troop," said he, "was
a very good name, an excellent name, something like
a wandering singer, didn't Minga think, or an acrobat;
and did the good Tawny make enough money to
support a wife?"</p>

<p>"His father is a big motion picture producer," said
Minga with dignity. She became calm and explanatory,
"and he dances my line of dancing. I work up
my line, you know, and so to keep him from the other
girls I am engaged to him; but we don't either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
us want to make it public," said Minga; "we know
too much of life," with a world-wearied air. "I
think one should be sure of a person, don't you? But
Tawny is a good dancer," and, with an indescribable
complacence, "this is a rather nice ring."</p>

<p>"I shall congratulate the son of the Producer," said
Watts mockingly. "Does Prince Tawny go so far as
to plan to produce anything himself? By Jove!
Here's your big pearl, a hummer! Well, now," the
lawyer was triumphant, "I've made good, anyway."</p>

<p>But an older man attracted for a moment by a vivid
little face always makes the mistake of speaking to
depths that do not exist behind that face while he
blunders on little vanities that do exist. Watts had
seemed too irreverent about the engagement. He had
not treated Minga as a valuable person to envy another
man the possession of; this by all the books
and plays that Minga knew anything about, was the
proper way to treat an engaged girl&mdash;there must be
envy from both men and women, heart-burning and
backbiting jealousies, else why be engaged? As the
lawyer practically cut the pearl out of its bed, washed
it and with a mock ceremonious bow handed it to
her with the disrespectful suggestion: "My wedding
present," Minga tingled in a way that he had made
her tingle before. With a slight, bored gesture, the
girl took the tiny treasure, held it a moment in her
hand, then with a sudden curl of the lip, and an unlovely
mocking in the eyes tossed it far from her,
back into the forest. Minga stood there smiling at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the man who had given it to her. She had a look of
diablerie older than the history of woman.</p>

<p>"Why, you little&mdash;&mdash;" for a moment the dark
brows beetled, then Shipman laughed, while Minga
stared insolently into his face. She glanced over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish we could have supper," she fretted.
"I'm so fed up with this place. Sard, have we got
to stay here all night? It's getting dark. Oh! I wish
the Bunch would come along. I'm tired of old people!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt but that the Bunch were coming;
the catcalls, the yelps of laughter and frantic
strumming of instruments came nearer and nearer.
Watts, sitting idly on the bank watching Sard and
Colter set out the supper, winced once or twice.
There was something blatant and raw in the voices of
the girls that even at that distance suggested squalid
things. The great lawyer had heard maudlin women
under many circumstances. Watts, like many another
professional man, knew that there was nothing more
awful in its debauchery and spiritual nakedness than
a civilized woman under drugs or loose emotion.</p>

<p>"What are these girls like?" he inquired sharply of
Sard.</p>

<p>The girl for a moment did not answer; Minga
giggled.</p>

<p>"Like Paprika and Chutney," she burst into a half-laugh,
looking meaningly at Sard.</p>

<p>"Sounds a good deal like one of Cinny's jags;
now where would she get anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush." The other girl's worried look stopped
Minga. But the rebuke in it seemed to nettle the
restless little creature, who jumped to her feet stamping
her foot. "Oh, I'm half dead with this old place,"
said Minga. "I'm cold, too. I'm going to explore the
forest; want to come?" looking over her shoulder at
Shipman.</p>

<p>At his smiling negative, Minga pouted. "All right,
then I'll go by myself." She made as if to burst
through the wall of swamp-maples, looking tantalizingly
back at the lawyer; but Colter, glancing up, interfered.</p>

<p>"There are bogs around here," he warned, "quick-sands;
one can't go very far without trouble."</p>

<p>Minga, shaking her head, started forward, half
laughing back at the two men who with concern
watched her. "Catch me if you can, anybody," she
called to them. "I'm the Lewis and Clark Expedition,
I'm Marco Polo, I'm going to explore, I tell
you. Who follows?"</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things of the decade is
that the coolest, most blasé girl of the time will under
the right combination of circumstances play exactly
the same game of sex that all her cave ancestors
played before her. Minga, the emancipated, the independent
and wilful, the haughty and undisciplined,
was now courting a very special thrill, the old cave-woman
thrill of expectancy to be captured and mastered.
Modern women of maturer age realize that in
asserting their superiority in general biological ascent
they are losing this thrill. It is extremely edifying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
study the devices by which they seek to experience
while they theoretically disclaim it; a sort of eat-your-cake-and-have-it
idea that must necessarily result in
some very queer psychoses.</p>

<p>The little scarlet figure, peering through the bushes,
deliberately grinned her challenge at Shipman; the
tall, composed man, looking on with appreciation, deliberately
grinned back, but the more mature grin was
a little forced. Watts Shipman understood, he understood
very perfectly, he therefore did not pursue; it
was Colter who with a worried exclamation darted
after the girl rapidly disappearing in the swamp
brush.</p>

<p>Sard, also standing up, suddenly noticed that it was
growing toward twilight.</p>

<p>She stood there looking so lovely, with her worried
eyes, the fine toss of her head, the lips parted, that
Shipman instinctively drew near to her. "I wish we
had gone with Dunstan," said the girl half to herself.
Sard looked over to the lawyer. "You remember my
brother?" she asked simply. "It was he who took
Minga home that night," blushing a little in this new
comradeship, to remember her own stiffness and aloofness
that night.</p>

<p>"You're very fond of him?" Watts asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sard sighed. "I wish I could steer him
right, but," the girl drew her brows together, "none
of us seem able to help each other much." She looked
at the lawyer smiling. "Sometimes," she confessed,
"I worry."</p>

<p>"Of course you worry," said Watts softly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
lawyer liked being near her. He felt her clear honesty
pouring all over him. Soft, pellucid, like the refreshment
of clean water: "Of course you worry, but
you will get tired if we keep on standing here. Sit
down; let me take care of you."</p>

<p>The girl smiled; she very gladly let him take care of
her. Sard, every inch of her capable and alert, had
yet the power of those really powerful among women,
that of letting a man show toward her his own best,
the thing bred in him by his muscular superiority, the
mother-taught sacred thing of his chivalry.</p>

<p>Watts, marveling at the grace of the girl, at her
lovely calmness and steadiness, spread out the shawls
on the bank. He piled the cushions back of her; he
collected twigs and lighted a little fire. "It will be a
beacon for them to find their way back," he said. "I
rather fancy that little witch, Minga, will put your
man through his paces; but he seems resourceful."</p>

<p>"They will be back soon," agreed Sard dubiously.</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at her at last. "I don't care if
they don't come back too soon," he said in a curious
voice. Shipman felt suddenly young, and it was twilight
and there were bird notes in the woods.</p>

<p>"Oh, but we must have supper and get back before
Aunt Reely begins to worry."</p>

<p>"But," he said, "this is the time to talk to you,
the time I've been waiting for." Then as he saw her
little questioning glance, "It's been on my mind to talk
to you about Terence O'Brien. The trial comes off
next week. I have got to tell you, Miss Bogart, that
his chances are very slim. But let's not talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
that. What I really want is," said Shipman slowly,
his eyes fixed steadily on hers, "what I really want is
to have you tell me all about this mystery man of
yours. Tell me," he begged, "all about Colter!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class="center">SOPHISTICATION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Telling</span> Shipman "all about Colter" was, Sard
found, not so easy. To eyes fixed upon hers with inscrutable
powers of judgment, it was difficult to find
words for the story. Yet, as the girl, her forehead
slightly knotted, described the half-bent figure of the
vagabond, surrounded by a curious little ring of village
loafers, half prodded, half jeered into mumbled
answers to questions as to what he was doing there,
Shipman responded easily to the passion for decency
and justice that had swept over her who had driven
her car close up to the group. The picture of Sard
dominating the half respectful, half resentful loafers,
getting them to lift the dazed man into the car, was
vivid. Shipman could see the calm young ascendency,
the smiling way of giving directions, ignoring
comments. The lawyer could visualize the whole
thing, country smirks and all, as she related how
she and Lowden had driven Colter to the little
boarding-house, arranged for a room and the attendance
of a physician and finally left her own visiting
card and address and the sentence scribbled, "Come to
this address when you are able to work."</p>

<p>There was something so divine in this unconscious
recital of pure humanity that the man, sitting there,
had no droll look of question, nor raised eyebrow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
inexpediency. The fresh eyes of the girl sought his
for comment.</p>

<p>"I don't approve," he said slowly, "but I admire."</p>

<p>"But why don't you approve?"</p>

<p>Shipman looked into the young eyes, wondering at
their brown brook-like centers, slightly tremulous with
tiny shifting lights of gold. As the girl laughed, they
deepened into a curious maternal gleam, a hint of
motherliness. Fascinated by the clear purity of her,
realizing how little she could grasp of the hundred
cheap misinterpretations of her acts, he kept
silent.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you have 'approved' if you had been in
Colter's place?"</p>

<p>The lawyer straightened. After all, he was years
older than she, even winged victories could come to
grief; there were draggled wings and things that could
not be victories. He saw the saucy inference and became
somber, so somber that he had no answer to
match his mood. Sard chose to be glibly interrogative.</p>

<p>"You must have seen that he is not a common
man?" determinedly.</p>

<p>"You couldn't have known that when you picked
him up," was the slightly testy reply. "People can't
do these things; the world is slimy, putrid, about all
such things. The only thing that keeps the Augean
stables livable is people like you that don't know the
slimy things exist. I'm not at all sure," said the lawyer,
with a big brotherly air, "that you had any right
to carry the thing so far without your father's knowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>edge.
Suppose this man had been a stool-pigeon, one
of the bands that tour the country with plans for
house-breaking." As Shipman said the words he was
tearing stray leaves in his hands, watching the drooping
face, hating himself for casting a shadow on it.</p>

<p>"You have seen that he is a gentleman," returned
Sard steadily. If she had been an older woman she
would have played lightly with the thing, half caressing
the man in his chivalrous disapproval of her. But
the lovely thing about Sard was that she took no such
ways. While youth is youth it plays the game squarely,
directly, standing outside of its own little fortress of
personality, demanding, "Who goes there&mdash;friend or
foe?" and unhesitatingly letting down the portcullis
for those who show the right colors even though they
keep their visors down.</p>

<p>"I don't like to butt in," said Shipman, "but&mdash;but
I'd rather have you think a little more, yet. I don't
know; if you did think you wouldn't be you and you
are&mdash;&mdash;" The man muttered the end of the sentence;
he suddenly recollected himself, rose restlessly and
walked over toward the line of swamp maples walling
the inner woods back of the stream. He peered a little
anxiously into the rapidly glooming vistas. "I
think, Miss Girl, that you had better go a little slow,"
was all he said.</p>

<p>Shipman, himself, had been making a surreptitious
study of Colter, and had to admit that the man, though
apparently aged through some kind of exposure and
deathless sorrow, had every evidence of good breeding
and clean life. There had been a curious muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
thinness to the long body that had spelled fundamental
good health, though his cheeks were sunken and his
hands nervous. Shipman had seen from the very beginning
that Judge Bogart's man of all work at one
time had physical training: riding, perhaps, cross-country
walking; very much of a man, yet undoubtedly
some ne'er do well who for reasons best known
to himself had been willing to put himself under a
girl's protection and affect so silly a disease as amnesia.
Shipman balked at the amnesia theory. The
lawyer half grimaced at the possibilities of Sard's
awakening and disappointment. He cast about
for some way in which he could warn the impulsive
girl at his side yet help her in what she believed.</p>

<p>"People talk about training girls for the home,"
said Sard. She was standing close by him now.
"Why don't they see that the World is our home?
All our own separate little homes are just so many
leaves and petals on the great World-Flower. It
isn't enough to know how to run a little house with
two floors and a bathroom and a kitchen," said the
girl. "We must train our minds and our muscles to
be ready to help anywhere; in foreign countries&mdash;to
make homes in Hell, if need be."</p>

<p>It was said not recklessly or rantingly, but with a
New Conviction, the conviction of clean, honest youth
awake to the larger demand of the future and anxious
not to be surprised or appalled, but to meet those demands.
Shipman, something young and aching in his
own breast, something that had not been touched for
years, looked down upon the tawny head so close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
his shoulder; he caught his breath, "Winged Victory,"
he murmured.</p>

<p>"What?" asked practical Sard.</p>

<p>For answer the lawyer growled, "Nothing." He
wandered restlessly about pulling back the low screening
maple branches, peering into the depths of the
woods where low sunset bird notes sounded over the
wild geraniums and the ferns sent out strange bracken
scents.</p>

<p>"Miss Bogart, do you know the character of the
swamps through this section? Are there quick-sands?"</p>

<p>The girl stared. "I don't know," then suddenly
startled, "Why?"</p>

<p>"Just because,"&mdash;the man was listening intently&mdash;"H'm!
Yes, that's your man Colter's voice. I
thought I heard it once before. Do you suppose
he needs us?" He looked smilingly at her, anxious
not too greatly to disturb her. "Would Miss Minga
take chances with a bog or whatever? She'd do almost
any fool thing, wouldn't she?"</p>

<p>"Chances&mdash;Minga!" Sard laughed while she
frowned. "That's all Minga ever takes&mdash;chances;
her life is like a little patchwork quilt, full of queer
little bright pieces that don't match." Now the girl
herself listened, staring into her companion's face,
noting its strength and grimness. "I&mdash;I like him,
sort of," admitted Sard to herself. Aloud she said,
"Why, that's funny; just now I thought I heard
someone too, but it was down there," indicating the
direction of the canoes that could be heard farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
down the creek. The sound of the mandolins and
ukuleles had stopped, but wrangling voices sounded
from time to time and once more came the raucous
screams that Shipman had noted earlier in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"That's Cinny," said Sard, frowning in good earnest.
"Ugh!" said the girl irritatedly, "I wish she
wouldn't be so queer. I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" asked Shipman quietly. He
had the quality of the man whom she had seen that
first night at the organ builder's house, a quality of
control and strength that a woman might lean on.
Half unconsciously Sard did lean on it; a worried look
had come over her face. "I feel responsible for
Minga," she admitted, "for all of them; they're so
queer, so almost horrid sometimes. I get fussed wondering
how they'll turn out&mdash;they&mdash;they seem to have
no Law."</p>

<p>"They have the Law-of-the-Pack, apparently," said
Shipman, laughing. He, too, remembered that night
at the organ builder's house. He recalled the defiant
young faces fixed upon him as he had disciplined one
of their number. Shipman recalled the incident with
some satisfaction. He thought particularly of Minga.
"Little fiend, I'd like to&mdash;but that was just it&mdash;what
did one do to little fiends like Minga?"</p>

<p>His own frown was puzzled as he realized that it
was getting late and that Minga and Colter were missing,
yet what to do? Wait for the young lady to conclude
her vagaries, or go forth after her and so pander
to the vain little thing who had hidden herself in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to force him to search for her. Shipman half laughed
at the unaccountable thoughts that had stolen into his
mind; all Minga needed was to be well kissed, kissed
very hard indeed. The lawyer, standing straight,
drew a short breath. "H'm, perhaps it was time to
get back to the mountain top, to Friar Tuck, to a
plaster cast and a few old books and a pipe and some
memories. By Jove, it was time to get back!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Sard reached out and grasped the lawyer's
arm. "Listen," she said eagerly. "There!"</p>

<p>The touch, vigorous and arresting, sobered while it
thrilled him; he flushed like a guilty boy. The lawyer,
lost in cases and evidence and books, had not had
companionship with a woman like this for years; it
was like being with a young wind-blown tree or a sun-spangled
fountain. It was so fresh and spontaneous
and unconscious that it made him feel clumsy, lost,
like some uncouth being that must find a new soul or
else miss out on this companionship. The touch
brought back things, college day things that were vital,
almost Pagan in their care-free élan, so that his eyes
deepened, almost snapped as he, in his turn, grasped
the girl's hand. "There!" He mocked her. His
hand closed on her fingers.</p>

<p>But Sard seemed not to notice; she was listening
intently; suddenly her eyes widened and she turned
toward him. "That was Colter," she said decisively.
"Hark! Yes&mdash;he needs help&mdash;he is calling; we must
go."</p>

<p>Pausing, her face flushed and earnestly fixed upon
him, the famous lawyer suddenly realized untram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>meled
girlhood in all its essence of fineness and freedom;
what he did not notice was that at the sound of
the far-off voice of the man in the forest, her whole
being had expanded like a light and that she stood for
a moment like a young mother whose child cries.</p>

<p>"Coming!" she called.</p>

<p>Turning, they plunged through the green walls of
the swamp. Sard put her brown hands to her mouth.</p>

<p>"Coming!" she called.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two canoes rounded the little green
promontory that walled in the "race" and floated in
toward the small beach where Sard's party were encamped.
One of these, propelled by Dunstan Bogart,
moved slowly, halted now and then by the movements
of a girl leaning in the stern. This girl's idea of humor
seemed to be to lean forward and grasp the paddle
as it went in the water. From side to side the two
leaned, Dunstan trying to evade the paddle-grasper
amid the snorts and chuckles of them both. Suddenly
the paddle was arrested in mid-air.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! somebody has been here ahead of us!
Look at those traps on the bank there."</p>

<p>Dunstan, his face unlike its usual merry self, a
somewhat sodden look to his faun eyes, looked about
for the advance pearl hunters. Jumping out, he kicked
the empty mussel shells about, he reached forward and
inspected the picnic trappings and thermos bottles.
"Sandwiches!" he called out to the others. "They
haven't had supper, whoever they are; look, there's
a pile of driftwood for their fire," then with a whistle,
"Holy Cat&mdash;I say, Gert, here's my sister's thermos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
bottle; look at the monogram, S. B. And that's
Minga's plaid steamer rug. I know, because I got her
a pillow to match. Say, for heaven's sake! Let's
get out of here; we don't want to piggy-mix in their
party. Pshaw! they've beat us to it, pearls and all!"</p>

<p>Gertrude, lying back in the canoe, smoking, raised
her head. There was a gold serpent bracelet around
one of her brown arms, and around the waist of her
thin green jersey another huge gold serpent twined.
She made a strange exotic picture in the leafy dimness
of the late afternoon. Her dark hair, brilliant cheeks
and lips suggested Eastern things; one instinctively put
her against some background of pyramids and
sphinxes. When she spoke, however, the illusion vanished;
Gertrude employed the "chewing gum" accent
in all its undiscipline of inflections and jawful
mouthings. She had only to open her mouth and one
knew that however subtle and old the soul that lay
within her, the brain that controlled that soul had only
one idea, to get things, and to get them quickly.</p>

<p>"Why get out?" she asked indolently. "I thought
we were booked till midnight." Gertrude had prepared
her golden snakes for a forest moonlight.</p>

<p>"Well, if you think it's fair to Cinny." At this the
girl in the second boat sat up staring about her. Her
fair hair was tousled, her eyes were dull, and her
mouth hung loosely.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Cinny?" she demanded.
"I'm all right&mdash;I'm a li'l' slipp&mdash;sleepy, that's all.
Dunce, who's got the chawclets? I want some more."
With a burst of silly laughter the girl lay down again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
her eyelids drooping heavily, the young, full lips
pushed out in a coarse way, hateful to see.</p>

<p>The other youth brought his boat with this burden
alongside the bank where the first campers had piled
their belongings. "Wouldn't it be more fun to hang
around?" this youth asked. "The fair lady can sleep
there and we can just say she's tired out, sunburn and
all&mdash;y' know. Whassay we sort of stay and watch the
fun?" this fellow asked. The speaker, resplendent
in a white college sweater, with its ostentatious chest
letter, had a curious old man's look of importance and
prestige. On his hands were two extremely ornate
rings of cabalistic designs drawn by himself. His tie
was prodded with a gold nugget, his wrist-watch was
a sort of disease of jewels, he had in every motion he
made the self-conscious assurance of the fop, the sort
of man who is trained in boyhood by silly women to
"appear well" in hotels. "I don't care when I meet
my fiancée," he winked at Gertrude.</p>

<p>Tawny Troop, Minga's betrothed, well up in the essential
attitudes of good sportsmanship, yet now by
his very way of handling his paddle, showed the Miss
Nancy, the jeunesse dorée spirit that one felt would
take him a certain successful distance and then with
some untimely revelation utterly betray him.</p>

<p>"I think we should remain here." Tawny spoke as
one accustomed to being obeyed; his voice was soft
and his inflection pampered, but his tones had all the
assurance that is given by a large bank account.</p>

<p>Dunce looked at the man irritably. "All right," he
growled, "remain then." Dunstan was thinking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
general mess of things should Minga return. Instinctively
downright himself, the lad could not bear
the suggestion of intrigue that he knew Gertrude
gloried in. There was something so worried and resentful
in the deep brown eyes that the girl still in the
boat beckoned to him. Gertrude reached up a long,
well-shaped arm, sleeve rolled to the elbow. She
plucked at Dunstan, trying to pull him down to her.
"Poor little boy, come and be petted," she laughed.
It was the laugh of an old soul in a young body. All
the manner and experience of the woman of the low
lights and intimate perfumes was in Gertrude's gesture.
For answer the boy, standing on shore, kicked
the bow of the boat away from him; he sent it slanting
into the center of the "race," where it wobbled
about; the girl, eyebrows raised, took up the paddle
and lazily shoved it back.</p>

<p>"You beast! Why did you do that?" Gertrude's
mouth was large and apt to be a little over-delicious in
some of her planned scenes; but now it was hard bitted,
twitching, like the mouth of a wicked horse; her
eyes, long and liquid, were artificially enhanced with
violet shadows and her face set between great rolls of
lacquered hair, had moments of extreme craft seen
under a curious mask of self-indulgent ease and gluttony.
She reached over and, taking a chocolate, bit
into it with white teeth that seemed to have a meaning
of their own, her mocking eyes fixed on the sulky boy
on the bank.</p>

<p>"Have some delirium tremens?" Gertrude waved
the box of chocolates. It was a gift from Tawny and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
contained three pounds of candy filled with varying
liquors, French and Greek condensations that were
rather intense for the American head.</p>

<p>Dunstan glowered scornfully down on the girl.
"Ah! Why don't you stop eating that rat poison?"
he demanded fretfully. He turned to Tawny Troop,
now tickling Cinny's sleepy face with a grass blade.
"You thing in the bath-towel sweater, you thought
it was funny to bring doped candy, I suppose. They
like that at the Chinamen's balls and the other festivities
you frequent, hey? Aw, old stuff, old stuff!"</p>

<p>The tones were purposely insulting, but at first the
Troop merely chuckled for answer. Then he leaned
forward and kissed Cinny lightly. At this, something
latent in Dunstan seemed to take fire&mdash;he turned and
muttered things uncomplimentary. "Aw," he snarled,
"aw, cut it out."</p>

<p>"Now, Dunce, now, Tiger!" this from Gertrude.
But the boy turned to her with an ugly look in his
eyes. "Well, Gertrude Farum," said Dunstan slowly
and impressively, "now that we're here where decent
girls are, don't you think you'd better take a day off,
clean up, burn up the trash&mdash;y' know?"</p>

<p>Disgust was quivering all over the boy's face, but
his own accent was also thick, his eyes heavy; he had
had his share of the doped candy and something else
from the absurd gold flask that Tawny sported. Dunstan,
to his shame, had also had his share of such diversion
as this frivolous society afforded. Suddenly at
sight of the things belonging to his sister and the girl
staying with her, all the clean gentleman in him rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
up and accused him, and he suddenly found himself
entangled with things which he did not know how to
unravel.</p>

<p>But Troop, the exquisite, now spoke up. He appealed
to the girls.</p>

<p>"By heck! the darned lobster. Say, I think he
ought to apologize. Gert&mdash;Cin&mdash;don't yew? Yep, by
heck, I do. Say, man, you're, by heck, you're rotten
insulting. I'll tell the world you ought to be crowned.
You're rotten insulting, I'll tell the little old world!"</p>

<p>Dunstan heard the squeaking voice in silence. The
afternoon had been long and hot. Things had risen
in him that made his veins seem full of fire. He
looked this way and that, like a trapped creature that
smells clean water and wants to get to it. His ears
were singing, his eyes burning, and he dreaded both
the return of the two decent girls whom he loved and
a possible evening spent with the two girls before him.
He tried to speak but he knew that his own accent
was thick and uncertain, and he could have burst into
tears. There was Cinny lying abandoned, disheveled,
her small beautiful form too well revealed by the large
meshed transparent jersey she wore, her white face
soggy and debauched, her corn-silk hair dampened and
matted. A sense of degradation came to Dunstan.
The fact that the other two could not and would not
feel this obsessed him. Cinny was such a little fool.
He stood on the bank and raged childishly.</p>

<p>"We couldn't be commoner if we were wharf rats!
I've seen Chinatown people behaving better than&mdash;than
we have. We're a lot of vile pigs." It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
characteristic of Dunstan that he included himself in
the indictment. He turned toward the snake-wreathed
Gertrude.</p>

<p>"You knew that stuff was drugged, and you fed it
to us all," the boy, staring disgustedly on the three,
half sobbed in his frenzy. He went to the bank's
edge nervously, gesticulating. "It was a rotten trick,
and I&mdash;well, I know that we've behaved like swine,
and I'll say so. Yes, I don't care, I'll bawl us out.
I'll bawl myself out&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;" Poor Dunstan flung
out his arms in a passionate gesture.</p>

<p>"Aw!" they jeered. "Aw, say!" But the beringed
Tawny also rose. He stood wobbling his canoe,
stabbing at the water aimlessly, and the oratorical
manner he maintained would have been funny, had
not his very words revealed his befuddled condition.</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you," he swore solemnly, "that
you insult these ladies. Yes, sir! That's it, you insult
'em. If I had a gun I'd crown you&mdash;yes. That's
it, you insult these ladies." Tawny's tongue seemed
to cleave to the roof of his mouth; he wet his lips.
With a surly squint of the eyes, he faced the youth on
the bank.</p>

<p>"These ladies" did not seem particularly resentful
on their own account. But the squalidness of it all,
the silly and disgusting company in which he found
himself, burned up into Dunstan's head. The boy almost
hopped as he strode toward Tawny.</p>

<p>"Why, you hound!" he shrieked. "Who are you
to say that, you moving-picture Polly. I insult 'em,
do I? What did you do, you rotter? You brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
that infernal gold tank of yours and this sick stuff;
you knew those girls couldn't&mdash;couldn't&mdash;" Suddenly
Dunstan, with long arm, reached forward to the
seat by Gertrude. Snatching the candy box he tossed
it into the creek, all its remaining chocolate-covered
contents avalanching forth. He turned on the aghast
Troop. "Aw," he breathed, "aw, you worsted monkey,
you'll not bring candy like that again to nice girls.
When you come here again leave your cute candy with
the Chinks where it belongs."</p>

<p>But Tawny was now aroused. This was an attack
on a sensitive point. Getting all his jewelry straight,
pulling down his monogrammed white sweater, he
rose, as one towering on the rostrum and stood feet
planted wide apart in the wobbling craft. He met
Dunstan's scorn with answering derision. "Yah&mdash;nice
girls?" he queried in his turn. "Nice, what? Oh,
come on! Nice girls, I'll say!" mimicked the sarcastic
Tawny. He regarded his suave finger-nails and
over them cast one eye on the recumbent Cinny, the
other on the snake-wreathed Gertrude. He sneered
back at his antagonist. "Nice girls; root for 'em by
your lonesome. Nobody else'll help you. Nice girls,
nothing!"</p>

<p>This was too much for Dunstan. The trip for him
had been miserable anyway. He had found the party
which he had entered with a slight measure of distrust
to be entirely dominated by the Exquisite, and the subsequent
unwholesome revelations of Cinny the lackadaisical,
and Gertrude the importunate, had beguiled
him into that dubious activity known as "being a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
sport." Dunstan, out of a very clean straightforward
heritage, felt somehow vulgarized, degraded. Perspiring,
he waited like a crouching panther for the
other man to meet him on shore.</p>

<p>"Cinny!" shrieked Gertrude, with her hard laugh.
"Wake up, Honey, here's something worth while!
Dunstan, the great chewing-gum champion, is going to
meet Tawny Troop, the cutest little evader in the
Hackensack Backwaters. Who holds the odds?"
Cinny put up an indifferent hand to her fair hair, one
of the cushions fell overboard, also a ukulele. Gertrude,
with an exclamation, paddled over and rescued
these; she leaned over to Cinny, saying sharply:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you? Why can't you sit
up and behave? Don't you realize that Sard and
Minga are around here somewhere?" Gertrude
leaned close over to the other girl, whispering very
distinctly. "Cinny, we'll have to see that we are not
any sportier than they are. Of course, no one knows
what they've been doing. Dunce is really mad, and if
he gets talking&mdash;you know that Minga is engaged to
Tawny." But she spoke to deaf ears.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone," murmured Cinny.</p>

<p>Dunstan, seeing the whole squalid meaning of his
party, burst into flames. He strode to the other boy
now getting out and meeting him on the shore. With
a grip like that of a young gorilla, Dunstan seized the
Exquisite Troop by his silken shirt collar. "Come
out, you sissy," he snarled, "come out here, you piece
of pallid pie-crust. You feed girls drugged candy, do
you? Well, you'll get fed, fed up nicely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tawny Troop was not the son of a moving-picture
producer for nothing. After all there was a
grand stand with two ladies in it. The Troop gesture
meant something; with a sound as much like an answering
snarl as he could make it, Tawny drew up in
magnificent hauteur. This attitude greatly irritated
the other. "Ah! Come on, you marionette," he muttered.
Dunstan cast about for something that should
rouse the other. "You paid escort, you Messenger
Boy." It was cub rage, but it was adolescent cub, and
it was somehow significant.</p>

<p>The girl Cinny rose slowly on her elbow staring at
them with heavy eyes. Gertrude clapped her hand
over her mouth to keep back a howl. The two boys
clinched, and it was an ugly clinch.</p>

<p>Dunstan's hand went straight to the throat of the
other. Here they met and the lad seemed to forget all
fair rules of fighting. A look of crazy joy came into
the hot brown eyes. Oh, this was a man's size job! a
good thing to do. Then Dunce saw the horrible look
of Tawny's face changing under his hands; yes, but
was this the way? Suddenly by some strange underground
channel of thought awakened by emotion,
Dunstan remembered the morning in the dining-room
his own jeering aside under his father's sternness and
"be hanged by the neck till you are dead"&mdash;that was
what his father had said when&mdash;men&mdash;when men were
sentenced for murder. Terence O'Brien, poor Terry,
young, young! Dunstan looked again at the face under
his hands; it was colored dark; this was the right
way!&mdash;to throttle like this!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the boy looked about at the trees, at the white
faces of the girls, voiceless, and his hands, flaccid,
suddenly fell away. "We'll stop," he said thickly,
"we'll stop. I don't want to fight. Oh! I don't want
to, don't want to fight!"</p>

<p>Tawny, a look of relief hiding some other look,
staggered against a tree, where he gasped wretchedly.
"You, you coward!" he shrieked, choking. Something
like a frightened sob gulped out of him; then
there was a sound of footsteps in the thicket behind
them. Four forms emerged. Sard first, alert and
making straight for the ready built fire, which she
quickly and deftly lighted; Shipman next, and after
them Colter with a small form held in his arms, covered
with mud and soaked in black ooze, Minga with
face and hair a mass of slime.</p>

<p>There was very little explanation. The fire blazed
up and the little figure wrapped in rugs given something
hot to drink. The others stood around and
watched her. Gertrude, with a hard stare, turned in
the firelight to Tawny. The girl was one cold glitter
of gold snakes and swamp dark eyes. "Your fiancée?"
she questioned, smiling. She was ironical.
While the other party waited for Minga's resuscitation,
the quartette started to get under way. But on
the down-creek trip it was Tawny who paddled
Gertrude's boat, and they soon outstripped Dunstan,
who came more slowly with Cinny asleep at his
feet.</p>

<p>The moon spotted the black of the forest and spread
silver on the waterways. All around the slow-moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
canoes were the waiting ones, the little wood creatures
who come out innocently for their pure trysts and unwitting
obediences to the great laws they honestly
serve. These stayed cleanly apart from the canoes
with their human freight, the strange mystical human
beings who are torn between their two great allegiances,
the animal and the spiritual. But only Dunstan
saw these things, and paddled solemnly and felt
like crying and wondered what serene wisdom the
summer night withheld.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class="center">A GOOD NAME</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Judge had come in to dinner in a bad temper.
For one thing he had been badly beaten at golf by a
man who could not speak good English. This thing
seemed to the Judge insufferable, a thing that should
not be allowed. Fancy being beaten by the long drives
and careful calculation of a hooked-nose oaf who
shambled in his walk and said "acrost" and "bee-hind"
and "I was to New York."</p>

<p>The Judge was beginning to feel his age in many
ways. His complete absorption in his calling made
him sometimes aghast at how differently life went
from what he stipulated. A nightmarish sense of
suddenly awaking in an unfamiliar milieu, in surroundings
peopled with beings he did not understand,
who did nothing he had willed, oppressed him.</p>

<p>The very weather was more progressive than the
Judge wanted it to be. The late June, lush and rich
with vegetation, seemed to impinge on his conception
of a world neatly outlined in flower borders and garden
paths. The weeds around his rose gardens had
accumulated! Colter had not yet removed them.
The man was clearly a shirker, endeavoring to impress
people with his superiority to work. Where was he
at this moment? The Judge had not been able to locate
him on the place. Then the whole attitude of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
immediate world toward the Terence O'Brien affair
affected the Judge. "In the good old days," thought
that gentleman, "men committed crime and we hung
'em and that was the end of it. Nowadays a man
does wrong, and what happens? First, the women all
over the country begin howling; then the newspapers
run amuck because some smart politician sees capital
in it; then the fool letter writers, E Pluribus Unum,
Veritas, and Uncle Felix, begin gassing; then some
lawyer sees a chance for notoriety and takes the defense,
first thing you know"&mdash;the Judge was almost
awed at it,&mdash;"the Bench itself, the Bench itself, is
put into the wrong!"</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia, amid accustomed twitters about hot
water, the instability of cooking gas, the fact that the
cream wasn't good and her other daily anguishes, yet
found time for soft demurring.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Shipman, brother, surely he couldn't
need notoriety. Why he&mdash;they&mdash;I remember the Ledyard
affair. Mr. Shipman got George Ledyard completely
exonerated, at least it was said so, though he
did commit suicide afterward. The thing ran through
the country like wild-fire. Mr. Shipman must be very
well known. Not that I quite understand, but there
was a famous scientist, brother to Mr. Ledyard, I believe,
whom they scoured the country for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Judge moved prohibitively and Miss Aurelia
ran down. "Women's clack," came the judicial sentence
on her remarks. "Women's clack, Shipman's
game is to take some mucker and put him on top; it
gets him well known and keeps the people for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
He'll run for something some day. Don't like the
man, never did." The Judge, having passed sentence
on Shipman, looked around in a manner of swelled
grandeur. Then his hard-boiled eyes becoming suddenly
conscious of the two empty seats at the table, he
asked abruptly, "Where are the girls? Hey? What?
What did you say? Where are they?"</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia, when cornered this sudden way by
the bushy brows of concentrated inquiry, invariably
straightened things on the table while her remarks became
more tangled and confused. The setting to
rights movement invariably gave her away. When she
accurately replaced a salt-cellar the Judge, perfectly
aware what uneasiness this connoted, followed her up
as a dog would a scared rabbit. He stopped chewing
to corner her.</p>

<p>"Hey? What! Why don't you want to tell? Hey?
Where are the girls? Can you answer a straight question?
Yes or no?" The Judge was sarcastic.</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia, taking up a tumbler, looked at it reproachfully,
then put it down with an air of gentle
resignation. "Why, brother, of course I can. Do I
ever do anything else?" The smoky, soft eyes had an
air of surprise and inquiry. "When you think of all
the questions that are asked me in the house and the
pains that I am put to in order to answer them fully
and plainly&mdash;that is"&mdash;Miss Aurelia caught her
brother's eye&mdash;"if I understand, or they, you&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;why
do you ask?"</p>

<p>The magistrate, now being sure of deceit and evasion
in the stammering lady opposite, played what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
usually a very strong card with her. In fact, the
Judge almost loved Miss Aurelia because she was the
only person of his household who regarded this as a
strong card. With an air of majesty, a thing that in
his young days he had practised until he believed in it,
a thing that would have made him a marvelous model
for a moving-picture photographer, he brought down
his fist until the lunch table rattled. Miss Aurelia,
well trained in her part, jumped. It was the thing to
do. Dora, bringing in the custards, looked nervous,
quite proper of Dora. The hard-boiled eyes seeing all
this took on a curious top film of complacency. The
Judge leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Now, if you can speak the truth," the Judge shook
impressively that thick forefinger which had so long
been unwittingly the little coffin nail of dead oratory,
"if you are capable of speaking the truth, where are
the girls? Did they ask your permission to go? Did
they take the depot car without my permission? Did
they ask that sneak Colter to go with them, also without
my permission?"</p>

<p>The curious something that sleeps in the frailest and
feeblest woman now rose in Miss Aurelia. She seized
a pepper-pot and violently shook it. "Stopped up
again," said she with a sepulchral voice. The lady
faced her magistrate brother. "I'm sure you have no
right to address me as if I were a shoplifter, for I presume
that is the way you do address shoplifters,
though it is true that I might be, that is, that you,
anyone, might be a shoplifter." Suddenly the poor
lady paused, for the hard-boiled gooseberry eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
steadily fixed upon her, at last had their wonted effect.
Miss Aurelia felt guilty, and that was what the
Judge wanted. It was his great pride that he could
make anyone feel guilty; he exulted.</p>

<p>"They've gone off somewhere," burst out Miss
Aurelia defiantly. "Why didn't you ask me before?
I'm sure you can't see anything wrong in that. Dunstan
had gone with&mdash;with some other girls. I presume
Sard and Minga have joined them. Dora and Maggie
say that Colter drove them in the depot car."</p>

<p>The lady made as if to rise and leave the table.
Her knees trembled, her stiffly starched white skirts
rustled, she was the old-time picture of femininity
swimming on the seas of its own emotions and expecting
to be rescued by the very man who had stirred
up the storm. But Miss Aurelia, with her flutter of
defiance and tears, had to pass the inexorable judicial
eyes.</p>

<p>"You are sure the man Colter accompanied them?"
asked the Judge in the low tones he reserved for
hardened offenders.</p>

<p>But now that screeching, protesting thing that is intrenched
in the soul and body of every woman burst
forth. Miss Aurelia was no longer early Victorian.
She was late&mdash;Margot-Tennant, the pent-up protester,
the savage that sleeps under the threshold. She rose
and shrieked defiance.</p>

<p>"Sure?" demanded Miss Aurelia, ruffling, "sure?
That's what you wanted to know all along! Well
then, why didn't you forbid it, if you were afraid?
You know how Sard does things. How could I help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
it? Have you ever told Sard not to be seen with this
man? I have worried about it all day. Not that I
fear for Sard," poor Miss Aurelia saw too late the
curious gleam in the Judge's eyes, "only she doesn't
realize that people will talk. The men in the Morris
bank&mdash;and all&mdash;why, only yesterday&mdash;&mdash;" but the
reminiscence trailed off like a whiff of smoke in the
blue haze of Miss Aurelia's mind. "Why should you
ask me such a thing?" she said. Her inflection was
enough to damn the entire expedition.</p>

<p>Judge Bogart sat back in his chair. He raised his
eyes to the ceiling with the air of registering an important
bit of evidence. "Umph," he said slowly,
"just what I thought." He pulled down his lower
lip, and looked at his sister. "Precisely what I
thought. It seems that I," repeated the Judge, staring,
"must take my own daughter in hand."</p>

<p>"Now, now," said Miss Aurelia, with a frightened
attempt to palliate; "nobody needs to take Sard in
hand. Why, she, they&mdash;&mdash;" But her brother waved
her to some strange dungeon existing in his own mind.</p>

<p>"You are acting in the capacity of Sard's mother,"
he said grandiloquently; "you have failed. It was
for you to have watched over her and to have kept
her from entangling matters, the sort of thing a hot-headed
girl gets into. You ought to know&mdash;&mdash;" The
Judge grimly paused.</p>

<p>But Miss Reely felt that it was not entirely discreet
to understand this inference that she "ought to know."</p>

<p>"How should I know?" She tossed her head. "I
never thought about such things, but," suddenly her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
old manner returned, "you are mistaken about Sard.
It is only the under-dog she is interested in. Look at
her about Terence O'Brien, and she has never even
seen him. She's been interested in under-dogs ever
since she came home from college. I never realized
it," confessed Miss Aurelia with a nervous cough,
"until Dunstan gave her that box at Christmas labeled
'Under-dog Biscuits,' and it had twenty-five dollars
in it for Sard to give to tramps." Miss Aurelia, in
spite of her perturbation, could not help the slight
tremor of a smile, but she sought to propitiate her
brother. "Of course," she confessed, "Sard isn't exactly
my idea of a lady, not a bit like her mother.
But she may grow more like her."</p>

<p>The man and woman in the Bogart dining-room instinctively
conjured up this possible resemblance to
Sard's mother, to the little curls and rows of buttons,
the little rings and chains and bracelets, the tiny web
of handkerchief and the sweet smell of scented lace
over a tightly corseted little bosom. Poor Miss Aurelia,
standing timidly back of her brother's chair, tried
faithfully to see her niece formed on this pattern and
utterly failed.</p>

<p>"The girls seem different nowadays. I don't know
what it is," she complained, "they take long steps.
They are&mdash;um&mdash;healthier. Don't you know how they
shake hands with you as if they said, 'Well, what are
you good for?'" Miss Aurelia pondered. "I was so
different in my own youth," she sighed; "you remember,
brother, I spent much of my time in bed taking
medicine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it kept you a lady, and a fool," snapped
Judge Bogart. Now he rose from his luncheon chair
with the effect of charging the jury.</p>

<p>"You can tell Sard if you don't want me to; my
time&mdash;my time," emphasized Judge Bogart impressively,
"may come later, that she is to drop all association
with this Gentleman-John tramp of hers.
Make her ashamed. Make her see the vulgarity of
the thing. If she rebels, why then&mdash;&mdash;" said Judge
Bogart darkly, as he stood there pulling down his lip,
looking at his sister. "There's just one thing I won't
have," he said emphatically, "a taste for low company.
Sard has that." He turned, surveying his relative
narrowly. "Even that little poll-parrot Minga has
more pride. The girl will have to learn that she's my
daughter, not the friend of Tom, Dick and Harry, but
my daughter. Tell her that, do you understand, <i>my
daughter</i>!" The Judge stood staring; he finished in
the voice he used so successfully in the court-room.
"If she can't take your advice, she'll take my orders."
At some thoughts of the girl, clear, steady, the Judge's
lower lip snarled. His legs seemed not to hold him up
well. He became a curious, insecure mass of anger.</p>

<p>Somehow after that the whole house looked different
to Miss Aurelia. She suddenly saw things through
the eyes of youth, youth trying to lift itself up and
away on broad paths of sympathy and justice. She
saw a common condition of things where the parent
forgets to grow but stands stiffly like a mile-post,
pointing proudly to a road that has long been choked
with weeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The tall, thin lady went slowly up the stairs feeling
somehow curiously young and chastened, like one sent
to bed on bread and water, as if she herself were
found guilty before this narrow tribunal.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she panted. "Oh, how did he ever grow
to be like this, so terrible? He was such a good
young man&mdash;such a good young man." Then the
thought that had once come to Dunstan came to his
aunt. Perhaps no one human being ought to have
power of life and death over other human beings; for
this was what happened to them. This hardness and
cold self-sufficiency, this was what happened to men
who condemned other men to everlasting dooms. So
when the hours waxed late and the young people had
not returned the good lady wandered from room to
room like a banshee. At last she went rather desperately
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Maggie, it seems late for the girls, doesn't it?
You saw them go. Were they&mdash;er&mdash;warmly dressed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," grinned Maggie. She turned from bread
mixing, a dab of flour on her red, kind face. "I seen
'em in their pants and all."</p>

<p>"Their camp costumes," observed Miss Aurelia,
with dignity.</p>

<p>"Camp or no camp," observed Maggie, with the
privilege of a good cook who knows her value, "them
pants is something terrible. That Minga! such things
will bring one doom or another onto her."</p>

<p>Maggie turned to Dora. "Look at them actresses,"
she observed, "and where do they end? It ain't no
way for a lady to dress, them pants."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>But the waitress, with some sense of her mistress'
anxiety, tried to soothe. "It ain't so late, Miss Bogart,
and they had their steamer rugs. The girls is
always careful; at least, Miss Sard is, drivin' the car
and all. And then, too, they've took that there Colter
with them."</p>

<p>Both women were evidently curious, and Cook
paused, anxious to see how Miss Aurelia would receive
this bit of news. Birth and breeding, however,
still accomplish certain reserves with the observing
ones of the kitchen. There was no further inquiry on
Miss Aurelia's part.</p>

<p>"It must be tire trouble," concluded that lady worriedly.
"I&mdash;they&mdash;that little depot car is rather uncertain.
I have often heard Miss Sard speak of it.
I wish&mdash;&mdash;" But what she wished Miss Aurelia
forbore to say. She started to go out of the kitchen,
hesitated and turned back again. "Have plenty of
hot water for chocolate, and the electric toaster and
jam. They might be hungry."</p>

<p>As the lady of the house departed, the two serving-women
looked significantly at each other.</p>

<p>"So, she's begun to worry already?" said Maggie,
her own red face troubled. "She's seen what we seen.
Oh, my! Wouldn't it be awful if Miss Sard was to
take up with such a one, poor, motherless child?
Wouldn't it be terrible, the Judge and all?"</p>

<p>But Dora shook her head. The girl, deepened by
her own worries, read things more clearly in the great
Human Book of which she was part. Mechanically
she drifted around the kitchen in her absent-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
way of the last month. "It ain't that, it ain't that,"
she said doggedly. "It's that she's the New Kind of
girl. Look how she's treated me. Look how she's
cared about my Terry. It's the New Way, and now
if that Colter feller is anything to her, it's that she's
all caught up with pity for him. Down on his luck
and all. She ain't thinking of nothing. It's the New
Kind of girl! They don't keep thinkin' of fellers for
marriage and all."</p>

<p>At a sound on the driveway, Dora went to the window.</p>

<p>"Automobiles," she announced. "That's them!
My! but I'm glad." Both women breathed dramatic
sighs of relief, and opened the kitchen door gladly to
see Sard's hatless flying figure.</p>

<p>"Maggie&mdash;Dora," Sard was breathless, "don't fuss
or make any noise, but run up and turn down Miss
Minga's bed and get hot-water bottles and hot drinks.
You see, she got into a bog and fainted. She may
still be a little chilled. Anyway, she might have
drowned, but for Colter. Here, this way, Colter."</p>

<p>Down the garden path from the garage came the
little group: Colter, the man on the place, bearing the
small figure, eyes languidly fluttering, drenched in
clammy camping things. Dunstan, stony and snappish,
was carrying the picnic impedimenta. Shipman,
an amused look in his eyes, stood about wondering
whether he hadn't better get out, yet taking curious
pleasure in watching Sard's selfless efficiency. On encountering
Miss Aurelia in the dim hall, he pulled
himself together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped the rabbity mouth, "you will tell me,
perhaps. There is no danger. You are a doctor?"
Sard had brushed by her aunt, refusing to answer the
torrents of questions. Miss Aurelia was now almost
in tears.</p>

<p>"No danger." Shipman's voice, full of his controlled
human tenderness, always influenced people at
once. It surrounded Miss Aurelia like a wall against
which the shaky lady leaned like a slender wandering
vine of femininity. She now leaned some more, and
inquired, "I thought they&mdash;you see, we know very
little about the man Colter&mdash;was it&mdash;did he attack
her?" Miss Aurelia, with sick tremulousness, put the
question and Shipman's eyes half gleamed with amusement.
The lawyer knew what a curious charnel house
the mind of a good country woman could be. He
knew the horrors this poor lady had visualized and
tried to relieve her anxiety. His polished concern
soothed her enormously.</p>

<p>"Your man Colter was very clever," he observed
quietly, "and resourceful. Quite a superior person, I
should say. He got to Miss Gerould first. The rest
of us had not heard her screams. She had floundered
into a deep bog and then fainted from fear, so that
the thing might have been pretty nasty. Then Colter
got stuck himself and we had to pry them both out.
Rather muddy work." Shipman held out his hands,
on which the swamp muck still left traces. His clothes
were stained with boggy ooze.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are telling me the truth?" gasped Miss
Aurelia excitedly. "The Judge will demand the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>act
truth, and you&mdash;you are a stranger. I can't be
sure." She was shaking quite pitifully.</p>

<p>Shipman looked soberly down on her. "H'm!" he
breathed. "H'm, hysteria, and not all from the anxiety,
either." What had gotten this flabby little soul
with the pretty complexion and hair into this state?
Surely not five hours' absence on the part of two
strong, independent girls. Had the Judge been fulminating?
Suddenly the lawyer grasped something,
something that he thought might become serious trouble
for Sard. Shipman stood silent for a moment
thinking. He asked, "By the way, is Judge Bogart
in? Would this be a stupidly inconvenient time to see
him? He is to try the case, I believe, in the O'Brien
matter. I am counsel for the boy. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia, enjoying her vine-like repose on the
strength of the personality of the "strange man,"
quivered a little. "I could find out," she said. She
faltered. "I assume that you are telling me the
truth, that you have no&mdash;no dreadful news to give my
brother?"</p>

<p>Shipman's tenderness was a natural and beautiful
thing. It went out instinctively to troubled men and
women. He took the thin, fluttering hands in his.</p>

<p>"Miss Bogart, it has been jolly to meet you in this
informal way. I want to know you better. Please
don't be troubled, please! Let me find Judge Bogart
myself. You go to bed and rest."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I&mdash;you&mdash;he&mdash;they," began Miss Aurelia, her
color glowing, her hysteria vanishing. She was fairly
thrilled with flutters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood over her, and shook a warning finger.</p>

<p>"You go to bed," he commanded sternly, "you go
to bed."</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief, Miss Aurelia obeyed him.
She led him first to the door of the Judge's study and
Shipman stood watching her slender figure mount the
stairs. Then he knocked. The "Come in" was
snapped in the voice the Judge kept for his family,
and Watts Shipman, with a shrug, entered.</p>

<p>Dunstan was standing on the hearth rug. The boy
had rings under his eyes; his mouth was eager and
breathless, as he had evidently felt the failure of
some protest to his father.</p>

<p>"All I say is," concluded the Judge drily, "is that
I want no more of this Colter rot. When your sister
wants to go on expeditions similar to to-day, you accompany
her!"</p>

<p>The lad stood there silent. The Judge recognized
the famous lawyer with a curt gesture. "Sit down,
sit down. I'm trying to make this young man understand
that he is responsible for his sister's character
and behavior; that they both live under one law, the
law of a good name."</p>

<p>Dunstan's face was afire. He stood facing his father.
"You call it a good name to suggest that my
sister needs my protection?" asked the lad ironically.
"Ah, a good name," the boy choked. "A name that
means finicking and fussing and being afraid and
continually thinking of evil. Well, I don't believe
either Sard or I want that kind of good name."</p>

<p>He finished with a curious gesture of despair, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
gesture that Shipman, standing soberly by, understood
at once. He loved the young fellow for it, for it was
Sard's own gesture. "Give us realities, realities of
sympathy and help and cleanness and good will. Do
not ask us to bow our heads under your standards of
what appears well." That was what the gesture said.</p>

<p>"Leave the room," commanded the Judge, "leave
the room." Dunstan, with a strange little look at the
lawyer, went out. Judge Bogart turned; in his hand
was a box of cigars. "I don't know what's come over
the young people of to-day." His voice was brassy
with anger.</p>

<p>Shipman took a cigar, held it lightly, then with a
gleam of eyes, half closed, to watch the match.
"Young people," he said, "must often wonder what
has come over us." The two men deliberately measured
each other. Then the talk turned to the O'Brien
case. What they said was purely superficial, but the
lawyer, raising interesting questions of technicality,
wondered if he was not perhaps the means of saving
Sard a lecture. A Winged Victory must have gotten
to bed by this time. Watts smiled. When at last he
rose to go he gestured toward the disheveled condition
of his walking things.</p>

<p>"I ought to have apologized. We got caught in a
bog looking for pink pearls." He was mirthful at his
own share in the escapade. "Quite a youthful time,"
he laughed.</p>

<p>"Humph!" Judge Bogart eyed the other man curiously.
"You found some fine pearls?"</p>

<p>"Your man Colter picked up one. Seemed to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
how to look; he seems rather well informed." The
lawyer paused. Perhaps this was an opening.</p>

<p>Judge Bogart reached up to snap out the light.
"If you're going to walk up the mountain," he remarked
curtly, "the back door is your best exit."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class="center">THE TAWNY TROOP METHOD</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dance at the Willow Roads Country Club took
place the night before Terry O'Brien's trial. Watts,
with some feeling of wanting the life pulses of the
Minga Bunch about him, went leisurely down the
mountain road clad in the golf tweeds against which a
club dance would not discriminate. As he looked in
through the long windows that opened on the river, the
lawyer was thinking that the indiscretions and bold
franchises of the youth of the day were somehow,
though coarser, a less harmful thing than the evasions
and concealments of earlier days. One thing the man,
staring in upon the throngs watching the little cubs of
the "stag line" with their important faces, noting the
calm, inexpressive faces of the girls, would have asked
for&mdash;enthusiasm. Watts reviewed the whole history
of the dance, Bacchante and stately minuet and
folk dance, gigue and morrice, and wondered what
good the dance was without the laughing lips, the light
of the eyes, the merry face. He saw the young figures
of the girls coming down the staircase, faces
washed of all human expression, calm, subtle, in some
instances of a Cleopatra-like Eastern subtlety, but
never gay. The tall, dark man, accustomed to reading
faces, wondered if indeed gayety had gone out of
the world. "Gayety," thought Watts, "means inno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>cence.
Perhaps in a machine-run world there can be
no innocence."</p>

<p>Down the staircase they came, scarlet and white
satin, blue tulle, black tulle, pretty gold and silver slippers.
Little necks filmy with powder, smooth heads,
coiled, puffed and banded, long white arms, smooth
white sides visible to the waist. Feet and legs devoid
of grace, thickened by athletics and crudely pushed
and planted in the unlovely strutting dances, yet not so
unnatural, not so different, just young things pushed
about by the great Energy&mdash;Life.</p>

<p>Any ballroom, the lawyer knew, spells but one thing.
In spite of its protected, assured air, its look of flowered
convention and jeweled dames playing propriety,
it is, in all truth, the scene of the play of young blood,
the attraction of young creatures. Since the days of
the excitement over Byron's "Waltz" the eternal
comment of men and women, wall-flowers and chaperons
evades this evident truth and registers the same
objection to all that is not sentimental convention.</p>

<p>But ballrooms go on existing. Watts, with a smile,
wondered how many dances were in full blast along
the Hudson River, so many fields of flower-pollen
flying that Friday night. His mind wandered back
over the fair old stately days of the great mansions of
the early Americans. He thought about Colonial
dances up and down this river, visualized homes along
the great stream, the time of Cooper's "Satanstoe,"
of Irving's homesteads, of belles of the Revolution
and the days of Lincoln. Shipman, with his own peculiar
imagination, reviewed the youth and beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
those days when, we are told, youth was so pure and
innocent, beauty so lovely and soft and mild and biddable.</p>

<p>Yet the lawyer, staring at the purple night of river,
pondered. If old pictures and old letters told the
truth there was always, even in those crinolines, in
those little cream and rouge pots and dainty curls and
fichus, Revolt. Who, dear indignant Mama, wore
those exceedingly décolleté ball gowns where half the
bosom was exposed? Does not old poetry hint at delicious
skins, and curves and fragrances and coiled
enticements? Watts grinned. "Funny," the man
thought, "it was all a heap more sensuous than those
skinny little muscular worldlings in there, only it was
unconscious. The Victorian tradition was somehow
able to have kisses stolen and little ankles noted and a
fervid, tight clasping waltz danced without for one
moment facing what the thing meant; so mid-Victorians
got by with little censure; but it was far away
from frankness and honesty and truth."</p>

<p>The tall, dark man staring through the windows
caught sight of Minga, standing alone near the entrance,
and he hastened toward her. The girl in the
blue gown with its orange butterflies had a curious
look of defiance and of being at bay that the lawyer
instantly noticed. Watts bent over her with real tenderness.
The little bobbed head was held very high.</p>

<p>"All alone?" The lawyer was no habitué of stag
lines; he did not know that this was a fatal thing to
say to a girl of Minga's group. But the music struck
up, and he, a lover of music and dancing, felt the an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>swering
striking up of his being. "Will you dance?"
he asked her, a little awkwardly.</p>

<p>To the man's surprise, Minga, with a curious little
catch of the breath, almost flung herself into his clasp.
Considering the difference in their height, they went
well together. Watts, with a sort of boyish pride, saw
the wondering, derisive glance of the important "stag
line" as they slid by. The room rapidly filled; the
babel and clash of the regulation dance was on.</p>

<p>Shipman loved dancing almost childishly. His
head, dappled dark, was picturesque; the curious grim
look of his dark face made him conspicuous among
the couples that interlaced each other in pacing, gliding,
backing measures. Miss Aurelia, seated in a row
of commenting elders, noticed Minga, her vivid face
laid not too restrainedly along the dark line of the
lawyer's arm; she indicated this to Sard, who had
brought Tawny Troop up to introduce him.</p>

<p>"My dear!" Miss Aurelia in gray satin and lace
was pontifical, "Isn't Minga too familiar, a little conspicuous?
Mr. Shipman is such a dignified man. I'm
sure he doesn't like it; but, of course, he doesn't know
what to do. What man would?"</p>

<p>Sard smiled. "Mr. Shipman always does know
what to do. If he thinks Minga oughtn't to do that,
he'll tell her so; but I don't believe he thinks so."</p>

<p>"Oh!" breathed Miss Aurelia; she spoke behind
her handkerchief to the friend on the other side.
"Happy little Sard," she said sentimentally, "so loyal;
she quite spoils Minga Gerould," breathed Miss Aurelia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the regular ballroom twaddle. Oceans of
this stuff is talked by watching, waiting chaperons,
who believe each other's statements with credulity and
an unoriginality quite wonderful in the face of what is
actually happening before them. Miss Reely turned
back to Sard. "I wish you girls,"&mdash;she dropped her
handkerchief; the exquisite Tawny restored it&mdash;"I
wish you girls understood what charm delicacy and&mdash;er&mdash;modesty
have for a man." Tawny nodded. "I'm
for it myself," he remarked sympathetically.</p>

<p>"But Minga doesn't want to charm a man, especially,"
said Sard gaily. "She just likes to dance
that way because everybody's doing it; she's probably
sorry she doesn't reach farther up Shipman's arm because
that would look more like the picture in
'Vogue.'" Sard, motioning to the other cheek-to-cheek
couples, nodded mischievously at Shipman.
Her own first dance had been instantly taken and
with a lively glow of color and enthusiasm she was
somehow glad to have the lawyer see it to be so. She
cast an appreciative eye on Minga's little azure form
with its butterfly corsage, the soft arms bare and free.</p>

<p>"Isn't she a darling?" she turned to Tawny Troop.
"You don't know how lucky you are."</p>

<p>To her astonishment the youth swept her with
raised eyebrows, eyes of nonchalance. "Oh, I say,
didn't you know that was off?" said Troop with his
best hotel accent.</p>

<p>To his suggestion that they should dance again she
took her easy position. Sard was the instinctively
high-bred dancer, the kind of a girl who without af<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>fectation
can give herself and her partner instant distinction,
with a poise, an éclat of rhythmic motion
that is very rare. Now as they circled the room she
looked up to the smooth face of the elegant Tawny.</p>

<p>"What did you mean about yours and Minga's
engagement? Surely you haven't quarreled?"</p>

<p>"I've broken it," announced the youth distastefully.
Tawny drew himself up with an air. "I couldn't
stand that last fandango of hers," said young Tawny.
"Don't want to marry a tough."</p>

<p>The music stopped with a splurge. Sard stood staring
at the young fellow. "You've broken it?" her
glance went quickly to Minga, who was leaving the
ballroom with Shipman,&mdash;the dark head bent down to
the little curly bob. "Oh-h!" Sard accused him
mockingly. "You're jealous! you couldn't mean that
about Minga! She's everybody's sweetheart; she always
will be. Why, even my father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Young Troop stiffened. "I don't mind ordinary
things, the game, you know&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" Tawny had the
grace to hesitate, then snapped, quite finally for one
of his youth&mdash;"I like any line that's decent, but when
you see your fiancée in the arms of a hired man, a
tramp she's spent the whole afternoon with, why
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Sard.</p>

<p>Tawny Troop, a young person of not very fine instinct,
had forgotten or did not know the mettle of
the girl to whom he spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing against Minga; she can do what
she likes, but," with insufferable American swagger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
"she's forfeited the Troop jewels; she doesn't wear
my brown diamonds any more, that's all." He laid
a hand on Sard's arm. "Don't eat the air," he suggested.</p>

<p>Sard switched away from his hand; her eyes hotly
repudiated him. "Do you care to explain?" the girl
asked coldly. "Minga Gerould is my friend, you
understand, visiting me; if you have anything to say
I will hear it."</p>

<p>Tawny stood irresolute. He had a grudge against
Dunstan Bogart; it was well to make this girl, Dunstan's
sister, feel something. The alert young bantam
figure of the unformed boy-of-the-world took an unlovely
attitude of assured insolence. Tawny smiled,
his thick lower lip in a sneer. "I've got the Gang
with me," he said in a low tone. "We all know you
and Minga hunt in couples; you hang together because
you're peculiar in your tastes&mdash;what? Only,
when that hired man of yours shows his preference
for one of you, the lovey-dovey business will crack!
See what I mean?"</p>

<p>They stood on the piazza that overhung the river.
The night boat, like a great caterpillar, set with golden
jewels, forged up midstream. The search-lights with
their white eyes probed the bank, moving over palisade
and promontory. Now a white ray picked out
some millionaire's home on the east bank, now some
white temple-like building on the west, now it shot
up to the sky, now it rested like the long honey-sucking
tube of a great moth on some arbored, flower-like
cottage along the rocky shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The music had begun again; this time it had an
Indian plaint, a long skirling cadence that might
have been sung in days gone by among the rocks and
trees of these very shores by a red maiden standing
wrapped in her blanket on a moonlit crest or staring
with great burning eyes into the rising sun. Sard
saw Watts and Minga go back into the ballroom;
the rose-colored light played over the little face lifted
to the man's dark tenderness, Sard looked after them
uneasily. "Everyone looks like that at Minga, but&mdash;but
it would be different if Watts Shipman&mdash;&mdash;"
Sard suddenly realized the power of the personality
that was shadowing Minga. Before this, the girl had
seen Shipman dominate things; did he then guess the
thing she herself was just learning? Were there protection
and care in the grim face with its look of
power and divining? Sard's eyes suddenly filled with
quick tears. "I could kill Tawny," the girl told herself.
"I could kill him if&mdash;&mdash;" but the "if" that
dwelt in her heart Sard would not allow herself to say.
She looked out on the river and spoke gently to the boy
at her side. She thought suddenly of Colter sitting
up there in the room over the garage with his books
and magnifying glass. It made her quiet. To be like
Colter, calm and patient with things, that was what
she must try.</p>

<p>"You mustn't mistake," she said with almost
womanly kindness. "Shan't we sit here and talk instead
of dancing? I'd like," Sard spoke with her
curious motherly little air of concern, "I'd like to
know precisely what you meant by that last speech.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
You mustn't say things like that, you know, it's not
done. If you apologize, I can explain to you about
Colter, but not unless," said Sard with girlish dignity,
"not unless."</p>

<p>Then Troop, the product of unlimited wealth, unlimited
license, turned and showed his true blood.
All his essential commonness, his cheap values and
squalid assumptions leaped to life. Sard looked with
the loathing of her true aristocracy of the spirit on
the shoddy training of this boy, who had the assurance
and ease of a young prince.</p>

<p>"I wasn't born yesterday," Tawny insisted spitefully;
the sensuous lines from his nose down to his lip
deepened. "What I saw on the Hackensack was
enough for me," said Tawny. "My faith! what a
girl will do nowadays! Of course&mdash;Cinny," he laughed
viciously, "but Minga Gerould, who could go anywhere!"</p>

<p>Sard almost giggled; the words gave Tawny away.
Young Troop thought still of "going to" places other
people were born to. The girl, instinctively disliking
him, yet instinctively parleyed with him. Sard, alive
to her world, to the quick back-action of the Minga
group, thought she could see Gertrude's hand in this.
That young person who schemed, who desired things,
who had unknown to Minga invited Tawny to the
house and to the Hackensack picnic and to this ball.
Gertrude was a young person who desired things.
Gertrude knew the history of the famous Troop engagement
ring and saw no reason why she should not
add it to the golden snake collection. Also, there had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
undoubtedly been aspects of the day on the Hackensack
that Gertrude must turn to other than their
rightful conclusions. Sard remembered the shrill
screaming, the maudlin sounds of gayety; she had
questioned Dunstan, who had flushed and turned away
growling. "Well,&mdash;we didn't find any pearls, that's
all; no, I'll say we didn't find any pearls," this with
saturnine inflection. Sard sat looking at the opposite
river shore strung with blue-gold lights, fruited like
long lines of orchards. Suddenly the girl saw the
world as in the old days court ladies must have seen
it, wanting to cry and bite out their little tongues or
the little tongues of other women. The spiteful small
messes of intrigue, the contemptible inference and
origins of personal slander.</p>

<p>"As far as I can see," came Tawny's drawling,
slightly nasal tones, "the girl was off with your hired
man chasing around those swamps; why she wanted
to jump into a bog with him I don't know, or was it
to get away from him? Any old boy would have
done, I dare say." Tawny laughed his cracked, old
man's laugh. "Of course, you all covered the thing
up pretty well. She's vamping that lawyer now!
Well, I must say she likes 'em old."</p>

<p>Sard, utterly generous, utterly untainted of mind,
could hardly take this fellow in. She leaned forward
anxiously. "You mean," she said gravely, "oh, what
are you trying to say?"</p>

<p>Young Troop had risen; something craven in him
made him aware that it might not be best to stay and
face such real emotion. Anger in Sard might be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
difficult thing to laugh off. He admired her while he
feared her. Now a breezy, heated throng spilled out
of the long doors onto the piazza; the girls perched
upon the rails and let the river breeze cool their hot
faces, while the boys leaned against pillars, hands in
pockets, getting off the time-honored persiflage of the
young dancing swain. Tawny saw Gertrude, in black
net, still entwined by the golden serpents and with a
green jade circlet round her dark hair. The great
dramatic eyes summoned him. "Thanks, awfully
much," he drawled in the silly parlance of the "star"
dancer. "I'll say I enjoyed it; that was some little
fox trot, what?" Tawny was edging away when
Sard Bogart, with a curious gesture of command,
stopped him.</p>

<p>"You mustn't think you&mdash;you can go on with this
sort of thing," the girl said in a low voice. "That
inference of yours stops right here; no matter what
there is between you and Minga&mdash;you&mdash;you can't go
on saying things." The now rather dismayed Tawny
found himself once more against the Bogart directness,
and squirmed uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Oh, forget it&mdash;I've 'destroyed the papers,'" he
quoted with dramatic raillery. "Minga won't get
shown up by me." Again Gertrude looking over her
partner's shoulder summoned him.</p>

<p>"Say, but isn't Gert a looker?" breathed Tawny.
"I guess she wants to be rushed next dance, things
getting a little slow for Gert; I promised to look up a
new crowd of cut-ins for her; well, so long!"
Tawny bowed with a curious half cross-eyed look of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
sneaking amusement. His eyes were smouldering
with a caddish kind of excitement; he could afford to
be good humored.</p>

<p>"Say, I'll cut it out," he pledged. "I'll drop the
story; I can't speak for the girls, Cinny and Gert and
all, they've been having a lot of fun with Minga in
the dressing-room; she took a good deal of guying,
they say. Of course," advised Tawny patronizingly,
"you ought to let her know it has made a difference
in her popularity."</p>

<p>Just then Dunstan came up. He shoved past
Troop, ignoring him while he elbowed him. "Sard,"
he said clearly, "I must ask you to stop talking to
this&mdash;er&mdash;cad. He has been discussing a friend of
yours, our friend,&mdash;well, I think we don't need him
in our vicinity."</p>

<p>"Your friend will need you both all right," muttered
Tawny vindictively; "she'll need you both for
dance partners and&mdash;and everything else!"</p>

<p>As the groups on the piazza filtered back to the ballroom,
Sard seized her brother's coat sleeve. "Go and
get Minga quickly," she said, "and Mr. Shipman if
you can. Oh, quick, before she realizes."</p>

<p>Dunstan looked at her, his eyes quick with passionate
fire. "So you've heard," he said wonderingly.
"Well, that chap is about the lowest skunk;
they don't have hells for that kind," said the boy
bitterly, "they just let them stew in their own juice."
But his sister would not listen; she was thinking
quickly.</p>

<p>"Go get them, dear; tell them to come out here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and then order some ice-cream and we'll make a little
party of our own."</p>

<p>Hastily Sard devised a way to shield Minga; instinctively
she thought of Shipman. "Get Watts,
too," she urged. Dunstan saw how dark her eyes
were and wondered. He half smiled. "Old Doomsday
book and Sard," he half chuckled under his perturbation.
"What a couple of old nuts, yet not so
bad, either." Then he thought of Colter and bit his
lips.</p>

<p>But Dunstan, hurrying for the door and seizing
Minga where she stood proud, bewildered, and alone,
grabbed her in true "cutting-in" fashion. "Gee,
I've been waiting for this chance," he breathed.
"I say, Minga, don't you dance with your host even
once in the evening?"</p>

<p>She shot a swift look at him. "Dunce," in a low
voice, "the Bunch think I'm&mdash;not&mdash;nice&mdash;they've
been saying things; it was Gertrude, I think," Minga
mocked with her little face. Her red lips quivered,
and Dunstan, with a curious look of man determination,
steered her into an increasing velocity and brilliancy
of step. "Bing! this is good music," breathed
the boy. "All right, Minga, old sport, eyes right,
head up, what? The rest of them are caterpillars
and worms, what? And Tawny Troop is&mdash;is&mdash;is a
butterlion&mdash;not even a chocolate pussy in a Christmas
stocking!"</p>

<p>The gay rallying brought the bright blood to the
vivid little face. Minga threw back her head and her
gay laugh pealed out, which was what Dunce wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
"Where's Shipman?" he asked, lips close to the fluttering
little head. Again the face clouded and poor
Dunstan, his resources at an end, gave her Sard's
message. "Say!" he tried to challenge the girl, tried
to help her keep the sweet gay insouciance, the so-called
"pep" that was Minga's greatest asset....</p>

<p>"Once more around the room," said Dunce, "once
more past Gertrude, the great Human Vampire-steady&mdash;once
more past the gang of glarers," meaning
the chaperons, "steady; and then out that little door
to the right. See? and then find old Sard, see? and
then a nice long spin out in the moonlight. Who
wants to dance this sizzling night?"</p>

<p>"All&mdash;right," breathed Minga, "all right. Say,
Dunce," but while she smiled and shook her head at
him for the benefit of the observing Bunch, Minga's
voice was trembling, "say, Dunce, you aren't a
good&mdash;good sort&mdash;or anything like that, are you?"</p>

<p>The boyish arm tightened. "I'm any old thing you
want," he said gruffly. "I'm any old thing you need,
Minga."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sard sat waiting for them, the soft
summer night cooling the cheeks Tawny had made
feverish.</p>

<p>"So that's the way Minga's law works out,"
thought the girl slowly, "and the law of Minga's
Bunch! She never even fancied this Tawny Troop.
She took him away from another girl just for the fun
of wearing his ring, and now Gertrude plays the same
game. And Gertrude, because she works for it, has
more power than Minga." Sard, leaning forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
looking into the ballroom, watched Minga and Dunce
finish the dance; she saw them throw back their heads
and laugh together.</p>

<p>As Dunstan and his partner joined her, Sard rose.
"Did you ask Mr. Shipman if he would join us?" she
questioned her brother; "where is he?" But Watts,
it seemed, could not be found, and to Sard's surprise
Minga seemed nearly frenzied as she stood there
trembling like a frightened child.</p>

<p>"Sard," the girl urged breathlessly, "the music
isn't very good, is it? Do you want to stay very
much? Mr. Shipman has g-gone up the mountain;
he wanted to&mdash;to turn in early on account of the case
to-morrow. Sard," Minga gulped, "I think this is a
stupid dance, don't you? Shall we go&mdash;&mdash; Come
on!"</p>

<p>Minga's eyes had deep shadows under them; her
face, under its not too well put on color, was piteous
and woebegone. Dunstan chafed helplessly; no one
had ever before seen Minga like this. It was insufferable
that any stranger should see it. The youth
tucked her arm under his and called up all his powers
of gay loquacity.</p>

<p>"You aren't all fed up, Minga&mdash;not you. Oh, you
little worn out society dame! Music not jazzy enough,
and she says 'the floor is gritty'; we'll have to fix
that. What!" Dunstan, looking over his partner's
head, raised his eyebrows at his sister. He nodded
violently and said with deaf-mute's emphasized lips,
"<span class="smcap">Take her home!</span>"</p>

<p>Suddenly Sard understood. Gertrude's propaganda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
had had its deadly effect. Neither she nor Minga had
their usual eager partners. The Tawny Troop stag
line of "cut-ins" was being marshaled for Gertrude
and one or two cronies. Curiously enough the
"Minga Bunch," the devil-may-care, unrestrained
crowd had turned and rended its gay little leader.
The usual way had been taken. It was not a very
new way; the way of gray-haired men and women
for other more devoted and more highly inspired
leaders, that of unanswerable personal slander.</p>

<p>The girl stood there aghast. Then she smiled a
little disdainfully and turned to her brother. "Will
you drive us, Dunce?" she asked, "or shall we call
a taxi?"</p>

<p>"I had a dance with Cinny," said Dunce, "but
she's sitting under the trees with that fellow with the
spook glimmers; she's vamping him for his new tennis
racket. I'll drive you. But," Dunce shut his teeth
hard, "when I leave this bunch I leave it for good
and all, you understand; you do too, Sard? You do
too, Minga?"</p>

<p>All the way home the three young things were silent.
They saw the dark trees slide by, half piteously,
wanting to run to them and hide their heads in their
soft branches and tell them things. All the kind
earth, the hills and the river, seemed maternal, strong
to their hot hearts, burning with scorn and contempt.
Dunstan knew painfully his own part in the miserable
intrigue. Tawny and Gertrude merely revenged
themselves, and they had taken it out on little, jolly,
happy Minga. As the girls got out, Dunstan stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
his car in a kind of blare of cut-out and racing engine;
it was like getting off the blast of his own
feelings. The boy groaned "good-bye" and was
gone.</p>

<p>Sard undressed in the moonlight. There was no
other light in her room, and so she had not pulled the
shades down. The trees towered into the white moonlit
sky and she saw the orange-colored glow over the
garage where Colter sat reading. The man's curious
calm life of books and plants, the way he kept aloof
yet was ready and effective, above all his patient
helplessness before the awful dark of his memory,
swept over the girl. Sard looked at her bed. "I
can't sleep to-night," she said. "I want to talk, to
talk to someone&mdash;I want&mdash;&mdash;" Sard went slowly
and looked up at the mountain where the organ
builder's house loomed back of the sky. She thought
of Shipman and smiled a little but lightly shook her
head. "No," she said, "he's kind, kind, wonderfully
kind and strong, but&mdash;&mdash;" The girl, a white crepe
wrapper over her nightgown, looked long and solemnly
at Colter's light; suddenly the orange square
darkened.... The man was lying now on his
narrow bed, the sweep of hair off that forehead Sard
knew so well, the long, fine hands lying careless and
relaxed, the fine sensitive face swept with its look of
suffering, perhaps already drowned in the great black
waves of sleep. Did sleep ever bring back to Colter
his birthright, did he ever see in dreams familiar faces
or hear voices? Sard found herself kneeling at the
window watching the dark window, her face flushed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
"I wonder, who he is," breathed the girl, "oh, if I
could only tell him who he is. If I could bring Light
to him!" Sard knelt, staring out into the dark, her
face hot, her heart pounding.</p>

<p>"I can't stand this," she muttered. "I&mdash;I feel
desperate, queer to-night. I might run out into the
night, anywhere, to anyone. I wonder! oh, I wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly she got up from her crouching position;
with tawny hair falling, tossing back from her forehead,
she caught up a little pocket flash and holding
it before her carefully felt her way down the tower-room
stairs to Minga's room. Sard knocked softly.
"May I come in? You aren't asleep?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. The older girl gently turned
the knob and looked in. The room was in moonlit
whiteness. There, still in her rumpled blue and orange,
the little butterfly back bare, the arms tossed
frantically out, she lay, the whole figure prey to
sweeping and tearing things. Minga was curled up
on the bed. There was no doubt about the little shivers
and shakes, she was sobbing.</p>

<p>"Minga&mdash;precious!" Something big and devastating
tore through the older girl's senses. She felt suddenly
old, like Minga's mother. This motherliness,
though Sard did not know it, was a keystone to her
being; it was the thing Shipman had half seen, it was
the beautiful balance of the Winged Victory. The
girl sat quietly down on the bed; so this was another
Law for her then; she must know keenly and helplessly
the sorrow of others, she must blindly strive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
learn how to help. Dora, Colter, and now little gay
Minga.</p>

<p>"Minga," urged the girl, pitifully, "don't cry like
that&mdash;why, it's not that silly Bunch, is it? We don't
care for them, we have other friends. Watts Shipman
and&mdash;and&mdash;-" Sard went a little vaguely over
a possible list of "other friends." There was no answer,
and she leaned down, trying to raise the buried
face. "Honey, can't I know?" then urgently,
"Minga, don't cry like that, it's&mdash;it's self-pity, isn't
it?" Sard groped about to give expression to a
thought that was hardly formed in her. "I suppose
self-pity's one thing we must never, never let ourselves
have," the girl said softly.</p>

<p>There was a sudden cessation of sobs, and Minga
slowly raising on her elbows turned up in the half
light a broken face.</p>

<p>"I can't help ... pitying myself.... I've
been so&mdash;so crazy; and now," shuddering, "I
can't play any more."</p>

<p>"You poor little thing, poor little thing," Sard
paused, her hand passed over the tousled head. This
young face and hand were inexperienced, but Sard
was like a pilot trying to pierce mists. "I guess we've
always got to play," she said, "even when we&mdash;well,
that Punchinello idea, you know. But anyway,
Minga, you mustn't cry like that because it's wrong;
it does something to your nerves. I remember they
said it in the psychology class."</p>

<p>"But I've done an awful thing," wept Minga. She
sat up suddenly. "Sard, you don't know what I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
to-night," Minga lifted her hand and passed it
swiftly over her face as if she would brush away
some new look of shame and repeated:</p>

<p>"I've done the awful thing; I wouldn't have cared
if it had been anyone else, but I felt wild after I had
given Tawny back his ring and I thought I'd take a
chance and so, oh, Sard, while we were dancing I told
Watts Shipman I loved him, and told him in a silly
way, a Cinny, Gertrude way, and that's the awful
thing; for you see, Sard, I do love him. Oh, I do,
I do," cried poor little Minga. "But I told him in
that way, and he doesn't respect me."</p>

<p>Sard, rocked by a surprise that bordered very nearly
on hysterical laughter, crept up closer to the little
sufferer.</p>

<p>"My hat!" she said in awed tones. Her hair swept
over her leaning face; she pushed it back. "My hat!"</p>

<p>Minga fell on her friend, burying her face in this
long veil of hair. "I did&mdash;I did&mdash;I couldn't seem to
help it&mdash;I was wild, you see, and I needed a friend,
a sort of fatherly person, don't you know." Minga
lifted her face and looked at her chum helplessly.
"He is the only person that ever scolded me and
made me mind, and so, you see, I loved him." There
was a long silence, then, "I think he's wonderful. I
thought maybe he could make me&mdash;make me&mdash;better."</p>

<p>Sard, with a rush of understanding, threw her arms
around the forlorn figure.</p>

<p>"Poor little thing," she crooned.</p>

<p>"No," said Minga with a kind of shudder, "not
that any more, Sard. I guess I'm different now; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
guess I've got to be a nut or high-brow or something.
I've got to grow bigger, you see," with a piteous gesture.
"I thought he might grow to care if he knew
I did, and I told him. It was out by that fountain,
you know, and the&mdash;the water seemed like tears."
Minga's eyes widened over her own poetic thought.
"My goodness," she ejaculated, "I'll always think of
that now when I see that fountain." Then she went
on, "But when I told him," the young voice broke a
little piteously, "he just took my two hands as if he
was going to sort of hold me from myself and himself.
Oh, a terrible way and then he said ... he
just said, 'You are a very dear little thing, you are
a very dear little thing'&mdash;and it was finished," said
Minga with her childish gulp. "I couldn't screech or
howl and make him come back. I&mdash;I didn't even try.
He just walked away from me. It was like a play,
only awful; he walked right straight toward the
mountain&mdash;I saw him in the moonlight and now,"
said Minga, "I&mdash;I have this awful ache."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, Sard trying to understand
this change in her friend. She began suddenly to see
as if unrolled on a flaming scroll another great law of
lives like Minga's, that whoever tries to control them
will lose them, but whoever knows how to control
them and does not try has them bound fast and submissive.
In the new days of the rapid rising of
women this fact contains a new challenge for men.
There is no reason why women should not rise but
there also is no reason why men, once superior, now
rapidly being rated as inferior, at least by women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
should not look into this challenge. If woman grows
more fine, why should not a man also rise and create
a new fineness that shall still dominate her and make
her happy in that mastery for which she will forever
ask.</p>

<p>The moonlight shone through the long luxurious
rooms, the silver patterns threw their strange symbols
on the floor until almost morning, and the dawn became
a steadiness of gray and rose.</p>

<p>When at last they parted, Sard looked thoughtfully
at her friend. "The trial's on to-day," she said
slowly, "and the Bunch are all mad, so they won't
go; and I don't think you ought to go, Minga."</p>

<p>"Just the same, I shall," whispered Minga doggedly.
"I'm going with Dunce." Then a thought
struck her. "Oh, Sard, did Dunce tell you what
Judgie is going to do to Colter?"</p>

<p>The other girl started. "Do to Colter!" Sard
paused at the door, her face scared inquiry through
the dawn-light.</p>

<p>"Well," Minga was sleepily yawning, "I think
Dunce said that Judgie had heard some of all this
mess and so he had told Colter to get out. He seems
to think it doesn't do to have a gentleman&mdash;well, you
know what I mean, for a hired man, anyway." Minga,
seeing her friend's face, was a little nervous. "That's
what Dunce said; you'd better ask him. Imagine!"
said little heavy-eyed Minga. "Imagine!"</p>

<p>Something slow, defined, inevitable crept around
Sard's heart, with a shiver; the girl tried to face it,
tried with her ardent and alert soul to know it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
what it was. It was hate, and it was hate of her father.
She trembled slightly, for as she looked into
her heart and saw that dark shape of Hate lying at
its door, she heard a soft whisper again in her ear;
little curls tickled her ears, soft whispering came to
her and her head was laid on a soft pulsating little
breast.</p>

<p>"We aren't afraid of Foddy, little Sard; we love
him; he won't put us in prison."</p>

<p>Softly closing the door, softly stumbling up the
steps to the tower-room, the girl tried to put these
things against that dark shape lying across the threshold
of her heart. "Oh, but he has put me in prison,"
she sobbed, "he <i>has</i> put me in prison&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;could
never make him understand." Sard threw herself
face downward on her bed. The birds were all singing,
the sun came with bright morning over the happy
sparkle of the river. A girl lay tearless before the
dark shape of hate and the memory of love and before
a slow dawning of a new feeling she could not
name, the old cry came:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother!" whispered Sard. "Oh, Mother!
<i>Mother!</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class="center">OLD LETTERS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> week before Terence O'Brien's trial Watts had
gone for one of his rare visits to Eleanor Ledyard's
home in its low valley of the Ramapos. He found
Pudge's home a tangle of lovely flowers, rich in smears
of gaudy color, and the long waves of canterbury bells
bowed to him in many tints as he paused at the white
gate. Pudge, himself, ran down the paved garden
path, a small turtle in one hand, a little willow whistle
in the other. Both of these were proudly exhibited to
his friend; also, mysterious news, the guinea pigs had
now several little guinea pigs of their own and the
doings of these piebald sacks of fur and ears were
rehearsed. Watts listened with interest.</p>

<p>"Mother's up in the garret," said Pudge. "She's
looking at letters&mdash;they make her cry."</p>

<p>Watts frowned. "They do, do they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, some more," the little fellow heaved a great
sigh and took hold of Watts' trouser leg. "I'm glad
you've come; when you come Mother doesn't cry as
much; sometimes she looks in the glass and smiles."</p>

<p>"H'm," said the lawyer. "I say, Pudge, do you
ever look in the glass?"</p>

<p>Pudge nodded. "When I'm playing Jack the Giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Killer, first I'm Jack and then I look in the glass; and
then I'm the two-headed giant and then I look in the
glass and try to see two heads on me."</p>

<p>Watts was interested. "A great game," he agreed.
"Now suppose you shin up my leg as far as my vest
pocket and see what's in it."</p>

<p>Pudge immediately essayed the shin, his little fat
form clinging and groping. The vest pocket and its
candy trove having been achieved, his friend put him
on a shoulder and galloped around the garden with
him.</p>

<p>"I'm sailing," crowed Pudge with delight, "I'm
flying through the air, I'm a pigeon." The little
hands ran into Watts' neck. "I like fathers," said
Pudge with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"What!" gasped the lawyer. They paused by the
water barrel and Watts, looking in the smooth surface,
saw himself with the little face looking over his
head.</p>

<p>"I like fathers," repeated Pudge; "they come and
play with you like this. Greddy Martin's father, he
comes and plays with him like this."</p>

<p>"But, old scout, I'm not your father." Watts
looked at himself in the rain barrel, and a thought
came to him. Guiltily he peered to see if it was in
his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, my father's dead," said little Pudge, practically.
"But you are something like Greddy's father,
and so I don't care."</p>

<p>The rain barrel image wavered a little; the lawyer
chuckled slightly. "Huh!" he growled, "I'm not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
father, I am a camel. I'm carrying you on my back
across the Algerian desert. Do you know what that is,
Pudge?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pudge, "we have it for dinner."</p>

<p>"Well," smiled the "Camel," "I've carried you all
across the Algerian desert and this rain barrel is an
oasis where you stop and pick a date off this little
peach tree." The two gravely picked imaginary dates
and drank out of the spring. "But you must be
careful when I drink out of the spring not to fall off
my back into the rain barrel." The camel pretended
to drink from the oasis rain barrel with dramatic effects
of allowing the small rider to fall into it, and
only by a miracle as it seemed did Pudge escape that
awful fate.</p>

<p>The little boy, his eyes shining, looked into his
friend's face. "Oh! we're having fun," he cried,
"fun like other boys with their fathers. I wish you'd
come every day! I like you."</p>

<p>"Supposing," said Watts, "I was to pitch my tent
just outside your gate here, would Mother let me
stay?"</p>

<p>Pudge deliberated. "She might, perhaps. I could
ask her," and hopefully, "Maybe she wouldn't say
no; maybe she would say, 'We'll see.'"</p>

<p>Watts smiled to himself. "How about food; my
black horse and Friar Tuck, my big dog, would you
bring us things to eat every morning?"</p>

<p>Now Pudge was slightly taken back. "You could
have half my breakfast," he promised as man to man,
"and one graham cracker," but the thing grew to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
present difficulties to Pudge; "and one baked apple
on Sundays," he faltered slowly.</p>

<p>"Nothing more?" The man standing there
squeezed the fat legs hungrily. "Why," said Watts,
"you'd surely let me have a little milk"; this camel
was becoming a responsibility.</p>

<p>Now the desert rider hedged a little. "Well, you
see," urged Pudge, "Mother wants me to drink all
my milk; you see," he explained, "the more good
milk I drink the more good boy I am."</p>

<p>"Sure." Watts slid him down to terra firma.
"Well, I guess we can fix it up some way. Now
about this mother of yours; let's stand down here and
call up all sorts of nice names to her and see which
one she'll answer, which one will make her come down
to us."</p>

<p>Together they stood, the tall man with the dark
dappled hair and the little shaver in blue linen, shouting
such names as occurred to them up to the little
garret window.</p>

<p>"Lady of Shalot," called Watts; he cast an eye
about the sweet summer garden at a seat under a big
horse-chestnut, "Lady of Shalot, come down and
speak to Pudge's Camel."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Pudge's mother," sang out the little fellow,
"come down and see my Watts Shipman."</p>

<p>"Blessed Damosel," Watts liked this game; his
voice held something whimsically tender.</p>

<p>"Dearest Honey-bug," this with a masculine swagger
from Pudge. But there was silence; no one appeared
at the little window. Could the lawyer have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
known it Eleanor Ledyard had stopped reading the
letters; an instinctive feminine hand went to her hair,
then a curious look of restlessness came to her face;
she did not, however, go at once to the window, though
the calling voice of her little son drew her away from
the trunk full of letters.</p>

<p>"That doesn't bring her." Watts' voice, purposely
raised, held the note of injury. "Why, I don't believe
she wants to see us," the lawyer spoke distinctly. "I
think she knows I've come around with my tiresome
questions. I say, Pudge, you know some people don't
care for me the way you do."</p>

<p>"But Mother does," came the little voice eagerly.
"She has your picture and she tells me long stories
about&mdash;&mdash;" A hand must have gone over Pudge's
mouth. Up-stairs listening, Eleanor Ledyard felt the
slow color burn in her face.</p>

<p>"Darling," she whispered softly&mdash;"you mustn't."
Pudge's mother quailed.</p>

<p>Watts, holding the little fat hand, squeezed it; he
looked up at the window steadily and something
mounted in his throat. He felt the desolate sense of
that trunk full of letters, of the woman patiently trying
to read and destroy and&mdash;forget. "Our names
don't seem to mean anything to that mother of yours.
Let's try others, let's call her&mdash;well&mdash;just the dearest
ones we know."</p>

<p>"I have," said Pudge stoutly. "Mrs. Honey-bug
is my dearest; I haven't any more dear names."</p>

<p>"Well, I have," said the lawyer decidedly. "I
haven't used up mine, not all the dearest ones I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
think of, only if I called up some," Watts was eyeing
the window, "your mother might scold me."</p>

<p>Pudge looked serious, then he clasped anew the
hand that held his.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she would," encouragingly; "you
try it."</p>

<p>As they stood thus hand in hand, Watts, knowing
that every word was heard, essayed his mischievous
worst.</p>

<p>"Dear Know-not-thine-own-heart," he called,
"Lady of Denial"&mdash;"Heart's Sorrow."</p>

<p>Her head, shining with its coils of brown hair, appeared
at the little oriel opening. Eleanor Ledyard
smiled down her reproof. "Watts, how am I to
keep at this thing which you know I must do if you
two don't go away and amuse yourselves quietly; have
I two children instead of one?"</p>

<p>"I wish you had&mdash;&mdash;" murmured the man. He
let something come into his eyes that Eleanor had
often seen there; the deep blue eyes with the black
lashes tried to meet this with womanly severity. Somehow
this morning the look failed. Watts Shipman had
come far to see a fair woman, and a spark of the
tradition of the cavaliers and men of romance was in
his blood. A lady at an oriel window was a person
who must ultimately do one thing. Come down! The
lawyer, his head bared, looked belligerently back, and
something in his gaze had made Eleanor turn from
the window quickly.</p>

<p>"I guess my mother is coming down," said little
Pudge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"She'd better," said Watts grimly, "or I'd have
had to go and get her."</p>

<p>"But you couldn't," said Pudge earnestly, "not if
she didn't want you to." Watts turned and looked
at the small, earnest face.</p>

<p>"Dear lamb, I know that," groaned the man. "I
know that; don't rub it in."</p>

<p>He called up to the empty window. "I say, Eleanor,
please bring that letter stuff down and read it
here; if you've got to do the deadly thing, let me
help!"</p>

<p>So the morning ended by her coming down, and
they sat very contentedly with Pudge making paper
dolls out of the envelopes his mother gave him.
Eleanor, with a sort of desperate haste, tore packet
after packet of letters. All those relating to her husband's
early life she had said she would set aside,
"something for Pudge to have." Others she tore up
so vehemently, into such small pieces, that the lawyer,
a mere man, wondered, and little Pudge, carrying baskets
of fragments to the trash-box, thought how much
Hop-o'-My-Thumb would have liked these paper fragments
for his trail back to his mother. That the
fragments were in reality part of the trail of a weak
man, father to her sturdy little boy, made a drift like
falling snow in Eleanor's heart. One letter she had
saved to show to Watts, and as the lawyer read it his
eyebrows went up.</p>

<p>When at last Shipman put down the closely written
sheets he bent his deep gaze on her.</p>

<p>"Well, that does look as if&mdash;&mdash;" he turned ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>tioningly.
"You surely don't believe Ledyard is
alive," incredulously, "Martin Ledyard, the great
scientific adventurer, alive and the world not know
it!"</p>

<p>Eleanor nodded. "I've always believed it." Her
eyes wandered to the bloomy-purple of the line of
mountains back of them. "Of course, I never could
understand why, if he was anywhere in the world,
why, when that happened he didn't come to us, to
George and me. And after George went, I wondered
more but I've always felt him alive, in the world,
somewhere."</p>

<p>Watts was thoughtful. "He might have been
afraid; he might have thought it would hurt him
some way, do you think that?"</p>

<p>"No," the woman lifted her head decidedly.
"That's not a Ledyard trait. Martin was as devoted
to George as I&mdash;almost&mdash;&mdash;" She shivered a little on
the word and the lawyer sadly watching her realized
that that word "almost" regulated the great gulf between
the deep faith of a man's loving, and the shattering
blasts of a woman's power of sorrow. Eleanor
was silent a moment; then she said dreamily, "They
adored each other at college, camping, on expeditions,
everywhere. Martin might have been crushed by
George's trouble, saddened beyond words, but he
wouldn't have deserted; he would have come to us if
he could have!"</p>

<p>"But," the lawyer turned to the letter in his hand,
"this chap says that nearly all of the men in that
West African expedition died of smallpox. I re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>member
that year; it was fearful along the Niger;
there was a lot of red tape and the Entente governments
fought over whose job it was to stamp the thing
out. It swept the Congo, I know. They all died, this
chap Morrow says."</p>

<p>Eleanor Ledyard assented. "Nearly all, but they
never accounted for all. Tarrant, the man Martin
loved so, went first; and after that McCall, their surgeon;
very bravely, I believe. Then the Southerner
who partly financed the thing, did you read that awful
part where they had to send them down the Niger
in the canoes made of hollowed out trees? Well, they
and the natives say that six canoes came down and
that they burned all the smallpox victims in quick-lime.
But, you see, there was one letter from Martin
himself, very distressed, out of West Africa, at
Monrovia, I think, as he waited to embark for England,
and he says&mdash;this letter, dated long after,
sounds pretty nearly out of his head&mdash;'they are all
gone but me, and I was taken from the same canoe
as Tarrant. I was trying to paddle him down to a
village for burial; he had been dead four days when
we got there, a putrid corpse! Tarrant, my friend,
my beloved brother-in-science.'"</p>

<p>For a long time there was silence. The man and
woman sat staring at the blue Ramapo as the strange
scenes of the stricken men in the tropical river drifted
through their minds. At last Eleanor spoke: "And
then came 'George's Trial.'" Watts saw the terrible
effort it was to her to say the words, how she glanced
at Pudge at her feet, and then, "George went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
and Martin never came to me. Nobody came to
me."</p>

<p>Watts sat there, the letter in his hand. "I came to
you," he said simply. She flashed him a look of passionate
gratitude.</p>

<p>"As Christ might have," she said with equal simplicity.</p>

<p>The lawyer, half irritably, turned away. "I wish
you'd drop that Christ idea," he muttered. "I'm a
man, I'm not a god. I am a man, and I want a dear
woman who doesn't want me."</p>

<p>She looked at him; her hands went out, her eyes
soft, pleading. "Watts, dear, I am always ready to
come from gratitude; indeed, dear friend, I would
come trustingly ... in memory of what you
did."</p>

<p>"No," he said firmly, "I want love, I don't want
your trust and gratitude, not even your dear hands
and lips." His soul leaped into his eyes, and he faced
her implacably. "I want the thing I don't believe
George got, but which you won't let me have. I
want you. Your whole being, <i>you</i>, Eleanor."</p>

<p>She sat there like a person stunned. The thing
that he had said went to some hidden place in her and
pulled aside a temple curtain; for a moment her eyes
flashed, outrage stiffened her form; then with a dignity
the man could not fathom, the woman who had
been a wife looked at him.</p>

<p>"I think," she said gently, "that you could not
have meant to say that, that you have forgotten yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the veiled woman of ice. Watts knew her
well. The man got up, paced back and forth, his
passionate heart pounding. Then he stood before her.
"I'm sorry," he said, "order me out of here if you
want to; I know I'm a cad." Watts, the self-controlled
man of the world, felt his lips tremble. "Order
me out," he blurted clumsily. "I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she looked up, smiling gravely, and took his
hand. "Sit down, Watts dear, don't be impatient and
try," her dark blue eyes filled with tears, "try to understand."</p>

<p>"I do," said the man miserably, "I do understand.
I'm a hound, Eleanor."</p>

<p>With a sigh the lawyer turned back to the letter.
"There ought to be a search for Martin," he said
thoughtfully. "What clues have you? Did he wear
any one ring or anything; was there any peculiarity
about him, scars or blemishes? Have you a photo
of him?"</p>

<p>Eleanor could remember a very slight defect, a front
tooth slightly broken. "He had fine teeth," she said,
"and that break was teasingly noticeable." George
Ledyard's widow took from the chain about her neck
a rather large old-fashioned locket which she drew up
from beneath her lace collar and silently she handed
the thing to him. Its slight warmth came to the man's
fingers in a way that made him glance suddenly at
her, wondering at the calm, unconscious face. Keeping
his thoughts down as best he might, Shipman
opened the side opposite from the reckless face of
George Ledyard, that face he had seen go through, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the trial, every swift change of the reckless speculator
and desperate trapped man; he glanced for an instant
upon the lips that Ledyard's own wife had said,
"Lured one until one was wrecked upon them."
"With such a face," thought Watts bitterly, "a man
can beckon a woman down to hell or up to heaven."
Watts dared not look again at the wife drooping there,
her little boy's head against her knee. He turned to
the other side of the locket. Something, as he looked,
rose like a finger post in his heart; it pointed to a set
of conditions, a tangled net of human things he had
recently known; but the lawyer did not instantly recognize
it, only slowly came the gradual shaping of
curious mists, and these settled in his mind like fog
settling around the tops of houses.</p>

<p>The other face was younger than George's, finer
and firmer, singularly a tempered man's face, free
from recklessness, but with the look of adventure and
an illumined look of pure kindness and intelligence,
very unusual in a face so dominant and assured. The
eyes, a little wide apart, were set under brows of resolution;
the build of chin and cheek were of a spare
sobriety; the lips, mobile and gracious, were a scholar's
lips.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he's gray now, if he's alive?
Same hair as George's? No?"</p>

<p>Eleanor shook her head. "I don't believe hair like
that can change, the curious red chestnut; we used
to think that the birds and animals he tamed so easily
came to him because he had that crest, a fine glittering
plumage like their own."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"He must have seen strange birds in West Africa,"
Watts said dreamily, "strange men and things."
The lawyer looked at her. "He might have gone
crazy," he said suddenly. "He may be shut up
somewhere; have you thought of that? The man's
rotten cowardly, else why should he have left you to
face this alone?"</p>

<p>Her eyes, deep and misty, looked at him. "He
loved George," she said quietly; "he would have come
if he could have; he loved George. Even you," she
looked at him a little childishly, "never did that."</p>

<p>Watts smiled at the feminine pettishness.</p>

<p>"No," he said gravely, "I just loved George's wife,
and I do still, God help me!"</p>

<p>She half rose; but his look held her. "I hoped
not," she said almost defiantly. "I hoped that that
girl might have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Watts, however, steadily met her glance. "Sard
Bogart," he said, "is, well, she's&mdash;&mdash;" he broke off,
looking earnestly at his friend. "That girl is going
to need friends," said the lawyer decidedly. He
handed the locket back to Eleanor, and with a curious
look, half awe, half ache, saw it slip into its
place. He stopped, something trivial on his lips. He
was glad at Eleanor's next remark.</p>

<p>"I wish I might help her." Her voice was calm,
sympathetic.</p>

<p>The lawyer was a little dubious, a little uncertain.
"I don't know; I've told her about you," he hesitated.
Eleanor half shrank and Watts added coolly,
"That you are my dearest friend." He stood up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
thoughtfully. "Unless you are going to ask me to
lunch, I must go. Are you going to ask me to lunch?"
he asked her.</p>

<p>The old drama began instantly between them. The
masterful, pursuing man and the retreating, doubting
woman. The thing itself took hold of them, but resolutely,
like people tempered to the grave concerns of
life, they put it aside.</p>

<p>Eleanor shook her head. "I am not going to ask
you," she said gently.</p>

<p>"Punishment, I suppose," murmured Watts.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. She also rose and
he thought that in her white gown with the rows of
blue larkspur and the canterbury bells as background
she was a wondrous fair thing that had almost too
much power over him. The man's mind flew to the
bright impulse of the girl they spoke of. Eleanor saw
this and her hand went out to his. "Bring Sard to
see me," she said it very kindly, "and that funny little
Cousin Minga. I used to see a good deal of the 'Mede
and the Persian'; they are dears." She looked at
him, casting about for something that should give him
comfort. "Next week you take up the O'Brien case,
don't you? Tell me, has the boy any chance? Can
you save him? Is it to be for life?"</p>

<p>Watts turned; he looked long and silently at the
sun descending, at all the colors and life of the flowers
about them, at the mountains standing like great blocks
of sapphire beyond the green fields awash with daisies.
Suddenly, he pointed to a little cedar tree reaching its
infant head close by their side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long do you think that little thing has been
there?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ledyard thought about two years. "It's so
cunning; it's planted itself. I haven't had the heart to
have it taken out."</p>

<p>"When it is a big tree," said Shipman slowly, "and
when his bones are brittle and when only images of
sin and failure and disease are graven on his soul,
Terence O'Brien will be called 'free.'"</p>

<p>"Free," she murmured; her eyes, fixed on her
friend's, read anew that greatest and deepest thing in
him, the passion for humanity.</p>

<p>She saw him fighting for a boy as she had seen him
fight for her own husband; saw his stern face and
iron gray head raised in its superb appeal to the pity
and understanding of the so-called "good" who control
the so-called "bad." Something surged up in the
woman, a deep something that was a triumph and a
shame. "<i>I could make this man happy</i>," her soul
said. "I could make him happy!" Then into the
strange quietude of a wife's memory, she withdrew
even as she gave him her hand and eyes. She was a
cold statue, a gracious being, a woman who had
known.</p>

<p>Pudge ran up. "Mother," the little blue figure
shouted, "I've caught a butterfly. He wiggles his
wings; he doesn't like it; he wants to get away."</p>

<p>The man and woman smiled. They showed Pudge
the meaning of wings, the reason things want to get
away and in showing, they were tender of each other.
When the little orange and black fans again wavered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
against the great wall, the blue vast of the morning
sky, Pudge himself got the sense of your true liberator!</p>

<p>"My, I like to let him go!" he breathed. He gazed
a little wistfully after his silken-fanned treasure, insisting
stoutly, "I like to let him go!" Pudge looked
earnestly up into the two faces, smiling at him. "I
want everything to go free," said Pudge, "except
guinea pigs!"</p>

<p>Watts waited a moment; then he took Eleanor's
hand in both of his. He waited until she lifted her
eyes to him. "I shall not come again," he said very
gently, "until&mdash;you send for me."</p>

<p>She was silent. "If I am ever to come," said the
man, "send me only the message that you need me."</p>

<p>He turned and was gone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class="center">EXPLOSIVE DUST</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> place has its own peculiar odor, from the
flower and candle-smoke scent of a graceful woman's
sitting-room to the tarry ropes and fish-net and canvas
sails of a boat-house; from the dried earth, rustling
bulb and flower-seed smell of a tool bin to the paint
tubes and mustiness of old draperies and cigarette
smoke of an atelier. Sunning mattresses, hot milk
bottles, warming squares and talcum powders, the
delicious smell of bathed baby flesh; scent of wooden
pews and velvet cushions, camphored furs and stale
incense of a church: every department of life, every
living thing, has its haunting, significant odor.</p>

<p>A country court-room smells of unaired dust, of wet
umbrellas and muddy rubbers, of onlookers who have
handled horses and gasoline, of doctors who have
come from operations. Smells of the coarse perfumes
of the criminal's lady friends, the bay rum of the
shining country lawyer, lemon peel and cloves chewed
by such persons as even in the most stringent times
of the Volstead Act appear always to have something
to conceal.</p>

<p>When the man-of-straw of outraged community
virtue is dislodged the court-room is redolent of prejudice
and policy and pedantry and plausibility; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
many things that lie on each other in layers like morning
griddle cakes. But it seldom suggests atmosphere
of health and light and true cleanliness and earnest
religious progressiveness; of the earnest desire to administer
true justice, of the earnest wish to
analyze specific examples of crime, to conserve all
goodness, to see straighter, more freely, with greater
charity and more modern scientific accuracy. Of
these things few court-rooms smell.</p>

<p>It may have been the stale, dreary, intrenched and
pompous atmosphere of the Trout County court-room
that finally drove the Minga Bunch from their
original intention of following Terence O'Brien to the
last ditch of his trial. Youthful enthusiasm and curiosity
had long since died out, leaving only a grudging
sense of clan obligation, and the long hours of reviewing
circumstantial evidence, the cross-questioning
of this and that dull witness, the peering faces of the
family of the murdered man and the grim and relentless
attitude of the jury, these things had somehow
robbed the circumstances of all their dramatic values.
The sight of Terry standing day after day in the pen,
his tow-colored hair always brushed the same way, his
eyes always nervously blinking the same way, and his
dry mouth unable to testify in his own defense, nettled
the group of young people who had interested
themselves in his behalf. They had supposed the
young accused would rise suddenly and pelt the people
with polemics. They had looked for dynamics;
they found only musty, fusty technique, sour looks of
old men, rigidities of convention and a bewildered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
effect of vital issues lost in a grand tea-party of form
and precedent.</p>

<p>Also, Watts Shipman disappointed them. Not experienced
enough to comprehend the poise and power
that lay behind Shipman's calm, his deferential giving
way to his "distinguished opponent," his punctilious
observance of every known courtesy and tradition of
the bar, they found him tepid and unconvincing. They
saw their great man as rather a simple soul, apparently
a negligible factor in the trial, apparently dominated
by the sleek, shining country counsel for the
prosecution, and did not know that those very simplicities
were the earnest of his greatness. The Bunch
did not know the modern function of the lawyer to
hold himself rigidly from emphasis until all of the
case has been digested. To work out by the slow
sifting of evidence the four sides of his construction,
the meticulous dotting of <i>I's</i> and crossing of <i>T's</i>, the
subterfuge of the trained, technical response of witness
when asked certain specific questions; in short,
the suave chicanery and subtle craft that has been
slowly built up around the narrowing arena where
two brains tourney for the life or honor of a prisoner&mdash;these
things were so much mortification of the flesh
for the restive "Bunch."</p>

<p>One by one the slow summer mornings of the trial
dragged out. One by one the "Bunch" dwindled
down. Dora, trim in costume, desperate in eyes and
manner, might have noticed this defection; Sard,
rather listless and weary, saw it with scorn; Shipman,
a slight glimmer in his eyes, observed it. But Minga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and Dunstan, coming religiously together every day,
both noted and registered it.</p>

<p>These two young people sat solemnly aloof in some
communion of spirit, waiting for some revelation,
what, they hardly knew. But to an imaginative onlooker
they might have seemed slowly in their young
hope to dim; their vaulting belief might have appeared
to such an onlooker to become slowly filmed
over by the long, long dust and dinginess, the hanging
cobwebs, the old parchments and papers, the pomps
and vanities, the emptiness and scaly dead skin of the
Law.</p>

<p>But Dust is capable of explosion, and the two
youngsters solemnly sitting there on the last day of
the case gradually felt themselves slow fuses in some
strange emotional bomb of their own planning. This
was somewhat heightened by a note that Dunstan
carried in his pocket. Once during the trial the lad
took this out and showed it to his companion; the two
heads bent over it, two brown hands clasped in solemn
vow. Two solemn pairs of young eyes swore some
consecration to a so far half-planned venture.</p>

<p>Minga seemed restless and scornful. She kept her
eyes on the proceedings with the air of one who should
say, "And this is what you call 'justice'!"</p>

<p>At last came the summing up for the defense, and
the great lawyer rose and made his plea for the youth,
who, sullen of eyes and unbelieving of spirit, sat
there. The court-room was full. Watts' fame had
been passed from mouth to mouth among the Trout
County inhabitants and all up and down the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
villages of the Hudson the lawyer's mission had been
told. Private automobiles bumped along the country
roads, jitneys from the ferries and from other counties
deposited their loads of citizens. The country
people, secure in their sense of collective virtue, untroubled
with modern analyses of crime and punishment,
unhampered with any passion for an adjustment
of punishment to environment and education, and keen
for the Roman Holiday, came to see severe sentence
of imprisonment passed upon one who had forfeited
his right to live among them. The jury, clean as to
shave, ostentatious as to watch chain, some perfumed,
some begoggled, one in hip boots, another in pearl
spats, all with an expression of wisdom and virtue
rather droll to anyone who knew the hidden chapters
of their separate lives; in fact, the Spoon River
Anthology, numbering twelve picked verses, filed into
the jury box, and "twelve good men and true"
mopped their foreheads and tried to look unconscious.</p>

<p>Outside, the summer morning was rich with promise.
Butterflies sailed two and two past the branches
and down into the deep grass. The leaves, turning
over like little green babies on their backs, warmed
their little stomachs in the sun.</p>

<p>The summing up was short. Terry, his half-formed
young ears pricking up, heard it, only half understanding.
Sard, Dunstan and Minga heard it rebelliously.
Dora, like a person in a trance, heard it
stonily.</p>

<p>The criminal had done murder, so the evidence had
shown, to obtain money for adventure and to further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
schemes for his advancement. No motive of personal
hatred or self-defense or vengeance could be found.
The testimony had been full, accurate and to the
point. Terry's curly, well-brushed head was on his
chest. Later it was raised and the boy was staring
defiantly around him like a young bull at bay and
desperately knowing only one thing, how joyous, how
magnificent it would be to charge!</p>

<p>Sard, sitting back in the court-room, looked from
the boy, all the muscles of his young back taut, to her
father. It was to her suddenly as if the whole court-room,
all of them were, under the Judge's power of
punishment, and that somehow his whole life, all the
whetted flavor of his existence was to mete punishment.
To the girl's daunted eyes, her father was as
powerful here as he was at the breakfast table. The
gray head was pompous and rawly defined against
the background of the American flag; the hard-boiled
eyes looked with a peculiar fixity, a muscular invariability
on every witness; the nasal voice with its few
comments, swift interruption and rebuke, its lifeless
adjustments and refereeship of the proceedings were
of an inflexible quality that the girl felt was not of
convention but of a hard, unimaginative, self-secure
and characteristic conceit.</p>

<p>So that when the counsel for the defense rose, three
young hearts in the assemblage arose with him. Yet
to their passionate wish, Watts seemed, standing in
the court-room here, to fall short. The distinguished
figure, the face tanned with a summer of outdoor
work and horseback riding, sobered with long, lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
vigils of thought, had, it seemed, great respect for
this country court-room, for its judiciary, for the foreman
of the jury and for his opponent in the matter
of the trial. Watts carried himself like a man who
had been impressed by the firmness and sobriety of
the proceedings. The lawyer let the court-room know
that he had had many personal talks with the prisoner.
It was his skilful way of assuring them that they
shared his passion for reforms.</p>

<p>Terry's head lifted, looking at him curiously. The
young fellow remembered revelations, tears, of one
night in particular when Watts had stayed with him
until dawn came and his hysteria was over. The boy
wondered what his friend would reveal of this. But
the great lawyer went calmly on with unemotional
emphasis to state that he had found the criminal's
mind vague, perhaps not properly educated, unformed
and in ignorance of the many physical facts that at
his age induce crime.</p>

<p>"And we know," remarked the speaker calmly,
"that there is an age in young manhood when a youth
is hardly responsible. The law, I feel, should invariably
in its adjustments reckon with the physiological
fact of that age. He had," he said, "talked
with the prisoner as he would have liked to be given
the wisdom at crises to talk to a son of his own, and
as"&mdash;here the man looked about the court-room into
the rows of dull and complacent faces&mdash;"it seems to
me it is absolutely incumbent on all of us to talk to
sons and daughters of our own frankly, giving them
truth and the clear analysis of all that makes in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
bodies and environment and heritage for crime; for
sins against ourselves and the body politic."</p>

<p>The lawyer then reviewed some mitigating circumstances,
touched lightly on some of the more interesting
technical aspects of the case and addressed the
jury on behalf of the commutation of the sentence.
Finally, with curious simple tenderness, a thing that
the court-room did not understand, at which Judge
Bogart looked displeased and drummed impatiently
with his fingers, at which the country lawyers openly
squirmed and yawned, but at which Dora sat tense
and straight, and Terry's young head went down into
his arms, he finished.</p>

<p>"If, Gentlemen of the Jury, you should still feel
that you must bring in the verdict of intentional and
deliberate guilt, then I appeal, your Honor, for the
commutation of sentence. I appeal in the name of
Humanity, of struggling, sinning, ignorant Humanity,
and by that new spirit which makes us disbelieve nowadays
in the 'pound of flesh.' I appeal, your Honor,
by my own youth's ignorance, its mistakes and struggles
and by the ignorances and mistakes and struggles
of those I have tried to help; by yours, Gentlemen of
the Jury, who take your solemn part in the decision
after the trial. I appeal to Terence O'Brien, the accused,
to take your decision, whatever it may be, and
apply it as a test of his own character and what he
may still make of that character; and I appeal to his
sister, sitting there, to make her grief and sorrow
noble, a test by which she may grow stronger and
braver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"I appeal," said Watts, looking down toward his
three young friends who sat with hot cheeks watching
him, "to all intelligence and sweetness and honesty
of women, all strength and cleanness and courage of
men to help Terence O'Brien and all such as he. I
ask, your Honor, that his sentence may be mitigated,
so that he may finally go back to a world acknowledged
the better by his punishment, and be received
by the world with respect and helpfulness. I ask
these things," said the lawyer in a low voice, "as I
know my own human soul and its potentialities, as I
know yours, sir," turning to the prosecutor, "as I
know yours, gentlemen," turning to the somewhat confused
jury, "and as I know yours," with a half smile
at the unimaginative audience eyeing him.</p>

<p>"For we are all somewhere, sometime, through
some guilt or ignorance or weakness and mistake,
guilty of punishable things. That is why we must forever
demand of our Law that it shall be administrated
with hope, must forever inculcate and advocate the
higher, healthier judgments of analysis, understanding,
temperance and mercy. There is no glory in
punishing predestined guilt; there is glory in shielding
and protecting potential criminals from guilt."</p>

<p>The speech fell painfully flat, as Watts must have
known it would. It left the court-room cold. These
country people, trained to the less analytical, more
emotional attitude toward crime and punishment, felt
somehow defrauded. The great lawyer had robbed
them of their Roman Holiday, of the raging and tearing
oratory to which by his very greatness they felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
they were entitled. There is an unconquerable love
among the half-baked for flourishes and figures, for
verbal fireworks and Mosaic utterances. No country
audience feels that it has been fairly dealt with in a
criminal trial unless it has been seized roughly by the
orator and dragged willingly over the entire gamut of
the prisoner's shame, contrition, despair, rage, vindictiveness,
and given a delicious peep at the unspeakable
and the unprintable.</p>

<p>The rest was technical. The judge dryly charged
the jury, commending, coldly, a consideration for the
youth of the prisoner. The jury filed out; the crowd
filtered forth.</p>

<p>Minga and Dunstan leaped from their seats and fled
forth under the trees. Minga's small face was pale.
She stood staring unseeingly at the crowds straggling
out of the little country court-house of Trout County.</p>

<p>People were already settling down with lunch boxes
or hurrying away to eat before the jury should return.
It was prophesied from mouth to mouth that
the jury would not be "out" long. Groups standing
about discussed the case with relish. The comments
were bald, stereotyped and pharisaical. The tiresome,
assumed impeccability of this crowd discussing one
boy's misdoings got on Minga's nerves. Who were
these people, some of them mean of face, too evidently
underhand, tricky and foul-mouthed, to condemn a
boy, only twenty, who had had them for example and
no mature chance to estimate the essential stuff of
life?</p>

<p>The girl, with unreasoning resentment and little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
understanding of the enormous values of the collective
sense of equity, watched Judge Bogart with slow
pomp, making formal gestures of greeting and dismissal.
She saw the two lawyers exchanging deprecating
amenities, and wanted to laugh. What a
play it all was! What mummery!</p>

<p>She watched Sard talking to Shipman and her
heart was hot with rage as the two exchanged what
seemed to her inadequate remarks.</p>

<p>"How's Winged Victory?"</p>

<p>Sard's hands went eagerly out.</p>

<p>"I'm still thinking of your speech. It's what I've
always wanted to say&mdash;to have said."</p>

<p>"You didn't exact more pyrotechnics!" He met
her glance quizzically.</p>

<p>"Ah," the girl breathed, "you spoke to their intelligences,
not to their emotions. You made people
think!"</p>

<p>"Did I?" Smiling doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, it must do some good!" she insisted. "It
must influence them some way or other, if not for
Terry"&mdash;the young, hopeful face clouded, "then for
someone else. Colter says&mdash;&mdash;" The girl hesitated
then went on quickly, "You made them use their
minds, you showed the relation of society to crime;
they saw that they were guilty of the Terrys of this
world!"</p>

<p>Lovely in her enthusiasm she added, "I was watching.
Old Mr. Fetherfew wiped his eyes and the garage
man coughed, and that young drug clerk looked
so curious and interested. More young people looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
interested than old ones," said Sard rather acutely.
"I think that some of them really understood what
you meant."</p>

<p>"You're too encouraging." Watts, smiling, stood
with one foot on the runner of her car. He was noting
the traces of worry on the girl's face. His good
news, that he believed the jury would bring in a
modified verdict and Terry's sentence would not necessarily
be for life, had not changed this look of worry.
He had seen Sard hesitate and flush consciously after
that arrested "Colter says."</p>

<p>Shipman had had his mind upon this girl and her
problem ever since the club dance. So Sard's little
world had already "made her ashamed." It had, with
its tawdry assumption, already begun to pass judgment
upon her. These were the things that sent young
people running amuck. What chance was there in a
community like this for the fine idealisms of youth?
Shipman thought. How much more stringent and
vindictive are the unwritten laws of so-called society
against the bold spirit that seeks to transcend it than
the concise preventive inhibitions of the state statute.</p>

<p>Watts had heard rumors of the Tawny Troop canard
and of the general village interpretation of Colter's
presence in this girl's vicinity. How commonplace,
how vulgar it was; how it could hurt her!</p>

<p>The seasoned man winced at the thought of that
pure spirit smirched with the stupid and bestial mouthings
of the ordinary community. He shrank to think
of his Winged Victory before the essential squalidness
of the minds with which she was surrounded. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
he asked no questions, he only looked thoughtfully
into the resolute fresh eyes, and there he seemed to
read a page newly turned in Sard's heart.</p>

<p>This girl, he saw, was slowly growing conscious
about the man, Colter. Jove, it was a pity! But with
the buzzings of the country community and her father's
cold isolation from the problem there could be
only one result: she would grow more and more sure
of this one personality whose cause she had espoused.
That was the way her kind met what it had to meet.
Watts thought of what things Sard might have to
meet. His dark eyes tried to read hers. "Courage!"
they said to her, and again, "Courage!"</p>

<p>"The Minga Group deserted, after all," the lawyer
teased. "A little inharmony there, I'm afraid."
Then, as he saw two young figures morosely eating
sandwiches under the shade of an elm, he went forward.</p>

<p>"Well, worshipful clients&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lawyer was anxious to get Minga past all shyness
and some painful memories. There was nothing
in his face but the look of one who greets an old comrade.</p>

<p>"How am I to spend my ill-gotten gains?" The
man asked it with purposeful lightness. "There's
about three hundred dollars that you contributed; shall
we give it to Dora?"</p>

<p>The two faces darkened. Minga threw away her
sandwich. She turned and faced him, impudently
looking him up and down. Her dark blue eyes glittered
with a cold dislike that almost startled the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
He regarded her with puzzled concern, amazed at the
variability of this little creature whom he had already
seen under so many different phases of emotion.
Now, Watts thought, Minga looked really dangerous;
something was added to her usual rebelliousness.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the girl flippantly, "let's do something
for Dora by all means, buy her a grand piano."</p>

<p>He did not answer. She went on bitterly: "That
will make <i>you</i> more comfortable anyway."</p>

<p>"I've disappointed you?" the man questioned
gently. Then trying again for lightness, "I was not
worthy of my hire."</p>

<p>"Ah," with quick dislike, "disappointed us?
You've been treacherous to us."</p>

<p>He was quiet, waiting to hear what she had further
to say.</p>

<p>"With your power," contemptuously, "with your
prestige, to just talk, to sermonize and philosophize
and make no appeal for him, for Terry. Oh," said
the girl excitedly, "it was like going past a drowning
person in a boat, telling all the while how to make
the boat safer for all the safe people, letting the person
drown&mdash;&mdash;" She caught her breath with a sob.</p>

<p>Sard and Dunstan looked wonderingly on this sudden
eloquence. It was not Minga's way to vibrate to
the sorrow of the under-dog. Only Watts' shrewd
brain guessed at the emotions that underlay the girl's
present scorn. The trained eyes perceived what was
the dynamo that augmented this passion. With something
very tender in the gesture he tried to take
Minga's hand but she swerved from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not, however, abandon the discussion, and
Dunstan, his lace masked and suspicious, stood back
of her. The youth scowled as Shipman asked slowly,
"If you had what you call my power, just what would
you do? Open all the prisons and turn out all the
criminals? Use it to protect one poor lad or to protect
many lads and old men and women and children?
Do you know that Terry's mind is psychologically the
kind of mind that naturally resorts to violence to get
what it wants?"</p>

<p>"But you have never believed that Terry would be
pardoned or you might have gotten pardon, or a fine,
or something," vaguely. "That was what we wanted.
You never really tried!" the girl passionately insisted.
"Nothing that you have said this morning but acknowledged
that you believed him guilty. You didn't
insist on his having another chance!"</p>

<p>The man standing there bareheaded, the lines strong
on his kind face, his dark, white dappled head conspicuous
under the low hanging elm branches, looked
wonderingly at her, seeing the tears cloud her eyes.
He longed, as he had longed before, to meet this defiant
little spirit with a passion of tenderness, yet an
old discipline controlled him. With his sober grasp
of life he sought to help her.</p>

<p>"You mean," the lawyer said slowly, "that I have
never believed him guiltless! No, I haven't; we all
heard his guilt proved. You expected him to be freed
because of his youth; you thought that possible. I
never did. Child," said the man, "there is always
punishment for wrong-doing; it is automatic. Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
it comes of the courts or of life, it comes! Don't you
realize that even a life-sentence might be merciful; a
deterrent, to keep Terry from the worse crimes to
which his inheritance and environment might lead
him? Try to have patience!"</p>

<p>Shipman held out his hand; he tried to make her
meet his eyes. He laid the power of his spirit on
her. "You want better, more intelligent human laws,
more enlightened justice," he said gravely; "so do I.
But, do you know how best to get freedom and justice
for all peoples&mdash;&mdash;? By obeying such law as there
is!"</p>

<p>Watts smiled at them, shaking his head. "Oh, I
know it's a slow way, a tedious way, a tame way, but
unless we all want to stay forever 'under the law'
with all the slavery and lack of progress that connotes,
we must be better disciplined, better educated
and more intelligent people. We must stay 'under
the law' until slowly and painfully and all together
we shall come to a consciousness of more Christian
and more intelligent laws to which we can all subscribe."</p>

<p>Minga drove her hands into her front pockets.</p>

<p>"I want justice," said the girl, crisply.</p>

<p>"So do I," was the lawyer's prompt reply. "I
want it, but I seldom see it."</p>

<p>"I want the justice that would give Terry another
chance."</p>

<p>"I want justice for the old cobbler whom Terry
killed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>He considered her. "There's only just one way to
keep the Terrys of the world out of jail."</p>

<p>She faced him, held by his magnetism, yet unbelieving.
Watts dominated her as he had that night
on the mountain. "Just by being better men and
women ourselves. The criminal is the man or woman
who analyzes and defies society, and in some cases his
arraignment of society is just." Then, with a voice
that thrilled with conviction, Shipman said to them:</p>

<p>"Never lose your passion for justice, for the under-dog;
never cease hating smug, secure, complacent
things, and never relax in your efforts to be more
intelligent men and women. I am willing to grant
you that there can be no essential justice in life as
long as there is no proper understanding of Terry's
temptations, his mental and bodily defects. To that
extent we, as much as he, are to blame for his crime
and we must never cease to agonize for him and for
such as he. It is our duty to raise ourselves through
education and our civilized dreams of justice to enact
laws that shall protect all the Terrys from themselves,
give them safety against their wayward impulses;
understanding of the disease of their crime; until that
time comes," finished Watts, "we are all under the
law."</p>

<p>It was with a wistfulness the others could not understand
that the man said these things. Manfully,
he tried to curb this young despair while he gloried
in and respected it. Some day Watts knew they would
forget this noble passion. They, like him, would grow
old, mature in worldly wisdom, willing to throw much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
into the terrible human discard, where so much youth,
beauty, hope and honor die in order that the artificial
fabric, called society, may be statically preserved!</p>

<p>Minga turned to Dunstan. "Then Terry," she said
under her breath, "has no friends but us." The two
looked at each other meaningly. They turned slowly
toward their roadster. They sprang in; the long shape
backed and snorted and left an angry trail of dust on
the summer highway.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class="center">AUTHORITY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late when the jury returned. The dusty end
of day completed their dusty deliberations. They settled
down in their seats mopping faces, adjusting
waistcoats, casting plausible eyes to the ceiling or
doubtful ones to the floor. The foreman, it was evident,
felt his brief authority. He was clearly sorry
that the waiting crowd had perceptibly diminished.
He stood, dyed of mustache, mottled of necktie, his
hair brushed in the country barber's idea of integrity
and truth. The rendering of the verdict was given
with his laborious elegance of diction.</p>

<p>And, suddenly, under even his smug sternness, the
dimly lighted building became surcharged with fatal
things! The old drama of youth and society, the old
tragedy was as evident here as in any Greek theatre
set in a hillside. Those who waited greedily for the
sentence felt a certain awe as it was given. The
Judge's machine-like voice had a cold inexorability,
very impressive. It was like a clock ticking out the
final words evenly:</p>

<p>"Twenty years at hard labor!"</p>

<p>There was a general intake of breath. To some the
sentence was disgracefully light; to others gratifyingly
merciful. There was a slow rumble of satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
country virtue. They looked at the prisoner at the
bar. Well, did Terry now know what the law was?</p>

<p>Twenty years at hard labor! Something torturing
made Sard's heart careen like a badly ballasted boat.
She got her first vision of the enigma of life. But
with Terry's sentence were they not all sentenced?</p>

<p>Twenty years at hard labor! Watts working for
human betterment, for clearer vision in legal things,
yet still under the law. Twenty years at hard labor!
Dora, working in the kitchen, always shadowed by
her brother's fate. Twenty years at hard labor! Colter
patiently striving to piece together his lost puzzled
life. Twenty years at hard labor! All the patient
workers, thinkers, teachers and trail blazers of
the great world! Was Terry in such poor company?
Were they not all condemned, all held down, suffocated,
frustrated, held back by the blind significance
of crystallized laws?</p>

<p>Sard stumbled over to the little group near Terry.
Dora, now passionately crying, caught at her hand.</p>

<p>"Dora," Sard's voice weakened in her throat,
"Dora, don't cry like that. It isn't only you and
Terry, don't you see we are all&mdash;all under the law?"</p>

<p>And then the little country court-house became
something very terrible to her; she stumbled blindly
out of it.</p>

<p>For Sard, poor child, knew that the chief issue, the
chief point of all the struggle would be missed. How
the trial of Terry O'Brien would be turned by the
countryside merely into a compliment for itself!
How it would be said that Watts Shipman, the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
continental lawyer, had been so impressed by the
splendid and inexorable quality of the Trout County
Justice, that he had tried one of its most sensational
cases himself! How the little country paper would
gloat over the thing and fairly tumble over its type
as it abandoned its usual clipped stories and boiler
press jokes about the mother-in-law, the old maid, the
unwelcome twins and the absent husband to flare into
three sticks of local felicitations! Veritas, Uncle Felix
and E Pluribus Unum would write their usual letters.
The Grand Old Man of the town would make
a speech and everything he said would later be corrected
and contradicted by the three Grand Old
Women.</p>

<p>The Roman Holiday furnished by Terry's ruined
life would obtain, but there would be no sober effort
for the understanding and education of future
Terrys.</p>

<p>On the way home Sard and her father drove in
silence.</p>

<p>The country roads were leafy tunnels through
which the lights of their automobile rayed mysteriously.
Owls and bats whirred away from them, mists
arose from the flats or filtered through the woods.
The Judge held his portfolio of carefully fitted papers.
In the dusk Sard saw him heavy, immovable,
his cigar in the corner of his mouth. Once or twice
he turned to his daughter as if expecting her comment
on the day's events. But there was no talk between
them and the Judge's face grew harder.</p>

<p>As they entered the drive he waved toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
garage. There gleamed no patch of orange-colored
light in the window of the room above; the girl's heart
suddenly stood still. As she took her hands from the
wheel they trembled.</p>

<p>Again the Judge pointed to the garage. "Leave the
car here, don't drive it around; a new man will wash
the cars to-morrow. I dismissed Colter this morning."</p>

<p>The Judge did not get down from the car, but sat
there smoking and turning his cigar. His gray lips
closing on it seemed to be the only thing the girl
could look at; she could not look as far as his eyes
and the Judge knew that her face became slowly and
suffocatingly a scarlet consciousness. He gave a short
grunt.</p>

<p>"Exactly; you're not to see him again," he said.
Then, "I all but kicked that fellow off the place."
As the wild tears rushed to the young eyes: "It's
your own behavior, young lady. I've never limited
you nor held you back," the Judge said grimly. "I
thought you were a lady; I thought you lived under
the right laws."</p>

<p>Under the laws&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Her father did not move from beside her in the
seat and Sard dared not press by him out of the
driver's seat. She sat, her straight figure dilating, her
hands clenched, the red stain on her face seeming to
burn down into her body and to make another sort of
woman of her&mdash;What sort? She could see what sort
her father thought she was. The piteous eyes were
dense with shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>At first she thought she could not, must not speak,
then a man's kind eyes, understanding, compassionate,
rallying, looked again into hers. "Courage!"
came Watts' voice. He must have known. The lawyer
with his priest's habit of the confessional of reading
storm and stress back of faces must have read the
new strange agony back of hers.</p>

<p>To do honor to Shipman's belief in her, she must
meet this thing calmly and without disrespect or passion.
The girl swallowed once; with lifted face,
turned on her father a look that might, had he noted
it, made him wonder. For the uplifted features were
swept clean of resentment. Sard was recognizing the
parent's claim on her, trying reasonably to meet it, but
the Judge saw only one thing; his hard, old eyes told
him he had made his decision just in time and that he
must act quickly.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you're letting yourself care for this man."
The tones, though not loud, lashed on her; the Judge
was deliberately making her ashamed. "I should have
thought as my daughter, even if not for yourself,
you would have had more pride."</p>

<p>Sard, slowly turning the watch on her wrist round
and round, listened. There was only one thing to do,
to try to meet the eyes, to meet the accusation with
respect. But&mdash;but where was the respect due her,
to her motives and actions? Had not this man, her
own father, been willing to degrade her in her own
estimation without hearing her, taking counsel with
her?</p>

<p>"Dad," she gave a little helpless shiver, "I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
think you know; you don't understand, or you
couldn't say such a thing&mdash;as&mdash;as that!"</p>

<p>But Bogart, taking out the cigar, smiled at it with
a shrewd squint. Well, of course, he did know, and
she, this untutored young thing, didn't, that was all!</p>

<p>Sard's father knew what would be the plans of a
ne'er-do-well who could make an ardent, indulged
young person fall in love with him. "Pah!" The
Judge's gorge rose at it, also at what he called Sard's
"deceit," it being the means of having him employ
this man, rose up and condemned her.</p>

<p>He saw her bowed head in the dusk, the girl's cheek
white on her blue scarf, and cleared his throat. "It
isn't pleasant," he admitted; then with a rasp, "I
never expected to speak to you like this any more than
I should expect to thrash Dunstan, but," went on
the Judge grimly, "under some circumstances I
should take pleasure in doing that very thing. Now
stop all this nonsense," he assumed that Sard was
crying. "I've had a hard morning," the Judge always
saw himself as unnerved by his court-room experiences,
"but I'm going to be obeyed."</p>

<p>His hand went out; it clenched on the girl's arm; it
was not hurtful, only hard, arresting and cold.
"You're to have self-control," said the Judge sharply,
"and you're to obey me! Understand?"</p>

<p>But she turned a set and stern face on him. That
soft echo of Shipman's "Courage!" had sent the
flame of all her ancestors in her. "You are not fair,"
she stammered. "I am ready to&mdash;to"&mdash;Sard quivered
over the hard word, "obey, but I can't be cut off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
dried up, stopped in all that I really care about." She
stiffened suddenly, flaring on him with hot mouth.
"Oh, you can't be my father, not in spirit, or you
wouldn't stand off and judge me, condemn me, like
this; you'd help me, you'd be," the tortured girl
caught her breath, "a friend; you wouldn't be willing
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For answer the Judge rose. He cast an eye to the
sky and took out his watch. "You have an aunt," he
said sententiously, "a woman, and a lady, to talk
things over with." He saw the curling lip of rebellion,
adding, "Of course, if you have no use for the society
of ladies and social equals, if you care only
for gutter snipes and wharf rats, that's your own
loss. My business," said the Judge, getting heavily
down from the car, "my business is to see that you
remember you're my daughter, even if I have to use
pretty severe means to make you.... My
daughter, flirting with a tramp, making herself the
comment of the town and the clubs, is a thing I will
not allow!" said the magistrate. "That is a little too
low!"</p>

<p>The cheap word "flirting," its hopeless connotation,
the inhuman density and commonplace acceptance
of the whole matter, seemed to goad Sard into a
frenzy.</p>

<p>"Ah, I'm not your daughter," burst out the girl
wildly. "I'm not the daughter of coarse, narrow,
cruel, smug things."</p>

<p>With the familiar eyes slowly turning on her, with
their awful arraignment of her as something vulgar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
unworthy, she quivered like a frightened animal. "I
don't feel like you&mdash;I <i>couldn't!</i> Such disgusting
thoughts couldn't stay in my mind&mdash;I couldn't be so&mdash;so
common as you."</p>

<p>It was out now, her condemnation of him. They
were pitted against each other, and Sard with a feminine
prophetic pang knew to what extent. The only
way to influence the Judge would have been her mother's
way, the little helpless scented timid lady's way,
and the girl knew miserably that hers could never be
that way. Yet here she was fighting, not only for her
integrity as a dignified woman, but for&mdash;for someone
who until now, but for her, had been helpless, dazed,
a fine sensitive being shut out of all human contacts
by his ignorance of what contacts were normally his.</p>

<p>The man turned and faced his daughter; something
remorseless came into his eyes. His mouth gripped
the cigar. "Either," said the Judge slowly, "either
you are my daughter and do as I say, or you don't
do as I say&mdash;and go&mdash;&mdash;" he muttered doggedly, adding,
"I don't care where!"</p>

<p>Then, his eyes professionally piercing, he remarked
coolly, over his cigar, "There, that'll do, you've
worked yourself up enough, you don't need to be
theatrical! Your duty," said the Judge pompously,
"is to drop all this poppy-cock about unfortunates,
the under-dogs and gutter snipes, whom you affect.
Be natural, be normal," said the Judge largely.
"Go around with your kind and your own age,
though, as far as I can see, they're as addle-pated as
yourself. Drop all this nonsense, I say, and <i>don't see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>Colter again</i>&mdash;do you hear?" For the girl, now that
he was out of the car, could turn her face from him.</p>

<p>The Judge slowly fulminated, gradually bulged
with authority. He seemed solemn even to himself
as he laid down his final command. He took the
cigar from his mouth. "Don't see Colter again!"
His eyes, reading his daughter's, he was looking mercilessly
on her young agony, making it naked and flaying
it, saw the writhings of her as she took the lash.</p>

<p>Sard made a slow desperate gesture; she had
winced, half shrunk from him, but she seemed resolved
now to meet the thing in its entirety.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said the girl in a low voice, "I can't
promise that. Last week, perhaps, but"&mdash;with a
strange little sigh of inevitability, "not now, Dad.
I'm sorry," Sard looked sadly into his face, "I can't
promise."</p>

<p>The Judge was stupefied. "Can't promise?" he
queried. "Can't promise? But I gave you my orders!
Do you realize what you're saying?"</p>

<p>"Courage!" Shipman's low voice, pleading for
human understanding, came to her. And another
voice, the calm, thoughtful voice of Colter. She saw
and recognized instantly her kinship with this soul
that had come to her so strangely; she knew that she
read it right and that no matter what its oblivion and
dismay, it had come to her, belonged to her. Yet with
all youth's insecurity and doubt she realized, too, that
she could hardly trust herself. Her eyes widened,
deepened; with a sudden strange, wild gesture she
threw herself forward. Her arms went half-way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
about her father's neck. "Oh, help me," she begged,
"help me! Don't you see that I can't promise? Oh,
Father," wept Sard, "why should we two be like
this?"</p>

<p>It was perhaps the truest sign, had the girl but
known it, of the depth of feeling that had been born
in her. When a woman truly loves, her heart goes out
to all those with whom she has a relationship under
the great new trouble; for her there must be no small
meanness, no stabbing dislikes, no impatience. When
a woman truly loves, she is tender to the world.</p>

<p>"I can't promise that," the girl wept desperately;
"won't you help me, Dad?"</p>

<p>But she might as well have asked help from the
automobile. With a strange gesture of disgust and
spurning the Judge held her coldly off. What he
said was reiterated with majesty. He slowly raised
the cigar in his hand and looked at it. Suddenly, with
a bitter ejaculation, a short wry shake of the whole
body, he flung it away. He passed the slender figure
that had thrown itself miserably on the turf at his
side and walked rapidly toward the house.</p>

<p>No one saw the Judge that long summer evening;
his study was vacant. The talking-machine was silent,
his goldfish pool, where he often sat feeding the
fishes, was deserted; and yet the whole place, forbidding
and shadowed, seemed full of his personality.</p>

<p>So Sard could not go to the house, she could not
see Miss Aurelia, discuss the trial, conjecture as to
Minga's and Dunstan's whereabouts. The girl, her
body aching, her eyes half blind with surging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
thoughts, wandered to the little fruit orchard. It
seemed to her that the gray ancient trees, like good
little crones, welcomed her, and that the long grass
and the rifts of leaves and patches of starred sky
spoke to her. "You are part of us, Sard; we have
struggled and fought, too; we have followed instincts
and been smitten and wounded. You are like us,
Sard, you have come into our laws."</p>

<p>The part of the orchard where the girl threw herself
down was dense and deep and its dimness cooled
her heart and mind. Concealed from the murmurings
of the house and garden, she lay pondering. The
kind little old trees mothered her; she opened young
eyes and stared pitifully at them, now clenching her
hands and softly crying, now softly opening them and
shuddering.</p>

<p>"<i>As if I had done something wrong! As if I had
done something wrong!</i>"</p>

<p>Her own sentence beat and hammered into Sard's
brain until it seemed as if she had done something
wrong. So, sometimes, suspicion and influence can
put guilt on a clean creature! Under the strange
half-awakeness, the half-conscious struggles of a
full-grown woman coming to life, before her there
suddenly rose the Gorgon face of Society, of the
thing called actual life. It turned her young heart
and body to stone. The looks and words of Sard's
father had been unmistakable; they had made her
warm-hearted interest in the Man on the Place, the
slow sense of delighted companionship, the mysterious
attraction and trust, something shameful!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>As if I had done something wrong! As if I had
done something wrong!</i>"</p>

<p>Sard turned miserably, staring up at the sky. With
the fairness, the willingness to face things peculiar to
her, she could in a measure understand her father's
anger and sense of outrage. The girl hardly rebelled
against this, unjust as it was, but her helplessness
with her own problem, the impossibility of proceeding
on this strange and rare path without shame and
mud-flinging, for the very path itself became evident
to her.</p>

<p>She remembered Miss Aurelia's twittering and misgivings
when once or twice she had gone to read with
Colter on a bench under the horse-chestnut tree.
She remembered Tawny Troop's cheap scorn; she had
been "made ashamed."</p>

<p>Even Watts Shipman, it seemed, had had misgivings.
He, too, had endeavored to "make her think,"
and now it was out. There was no hiding it, no possible
explanation; she cared for Colter, cared for him
with the marvelous gleaming tide, the dewy garden-like
rapture, the vivid, etched, romantic stir and
storm of a girl's first feeling. It was out; known, discussed,
condemned and made shameful. The scarlet
flame that had stained Sard's face brought a blazing
fire of pride into her heart. Boldly she cast imagination
and self-will on this fire of pride.</p>

<p>"I <i>care</i>," she breathed. "I care. It is my life, not
theirs! I will go before them all with Colter and
say&mdash;'I care'!"</p>

<p>The gray twilight grew darker in its language and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
breathed down to sleep. Roses emptied tiny jars of
scent on the night. Lilies burned tall pastilles.
Leaves pressed their little hands together in some
prayer of darkness. Now and then some small thing
like a clock stirred in the long grass near Sard and
tried to remind her of time and obligations, but the
woe of the whole youthful frame meant nothing to
them. They went on in their little ticking way, busy
and inevitable.</p>

<p>These things did, however, mean unutterable emotions
to the man who came suddenly upon them, who
viewed them pitifully in the long grass where long
ago the fire-flies had begun to rise and glimmer. To
the startled, half-rising girl's face, Colter half groaned.
Quickly he tempered his voice and manner. He, it
seemed, was in no passion of resentment, and he
sought to quell hers.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw you go in here&mdash;I waited a long
time for you to come out." Colter hesitated. "I
wanted to say 'good-bye' before I went. Do you
know how late it is?"</p>

<p>For answer she gave a long sigh of relief. "I
thought you had gone!" she said. "Is it late?"</p>

<p>The man looked at the girl lying there in the long
grass. It was a different Sard Bogart from any he
had seen and known since the early spring, since that
March day when she had rescued him. He could not
look at her thus. Something instinctive and delicate
made Colter turn his head away and remain standing.
Under the trees he stood immovable, like a statue,
thinking with utmost concern upon this prostrate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
abandoned grief of youth. He stood, his back to her,
looking out toward the slow gathering stars.</p>

<p>His quiet, the absolute calm of him, made Sard
wonder. Suddenly she sat up; her hands went to her
hair. She was glad he could not see her eyes and
wondered if he could have heard her sobbing. Again,
inquiringly, she looked at the tall thin form with its
broad shoulders and the head, nobly poised, set to a
listening attitude.</p>

<p>"If we are very quiet," said Colter at last, "we
can hear the wind freshening down the river."
Somehow, she knew it was the way he took to quiet
her. She was hushed like a storming child.</p>

<p>After a few seconds: "I did not hear you come."
She tried to say it naturally, but her relief, the long
shuddering sigh, struck into him. The man, his face
still turned away, murmured something.</p>

<p>"I did not hear you." Sard rose and went toward
him in the dark.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should not have come," he said. He
carefully kept the senses of mistress and employed
between them. "But I was very anxious. Shall I
go?"</p>

<p>"No." The girl's voice, under his steady leadership,
grew clearer. Sard began to get herself together.
Here was someone who understood, who
needed few words and who, she was convinced, cared.
Sard only thought that word "cared." She dared
not think the word "love," with its overwhelming
waves.</p>

<p>She stood there twisting a piece of grass in nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
fingers. "Father told me!" She said it with a kind
of helpless shame. "I am so sorry that you are going,
Colter. You seemed so happy lately&mdash;and I&mdash;I believed
that we could help you, take you back to yourself,
give you life again."</p>

<p>For answer the man turned and gave her one swift
look.</p>

<p>In the summer night Sard saw with wonder that
there was a curious competency, a serene purpose in
those eyes. In some dumb moment of wild joy she
realized that her instinct had taught her true. This
was no perplexed "hired man" with no friends nor
employment. This was&mdash;this was&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have helped me more than you know." His
voice was grave and restoring. "I have come back
further to my own than I dare think of now, and I
came by a beautiful path, your sympathy and pure
faith. So you must not sorrow like this. You must
not distress yourself like this. Things will be
clearer."</p>

<p>In the night his clear voice of authority moved the
girl strangely. It was an authority and assurance of
high character that in her desperately clouded spirit
she reached out for. Instinctively, like a wilting plant,
the young form straightened and freshened until the
man stopped looking at the stars.</p>

<p>He turned toward her and looked long upon the
face that had become his star. Colter made a little
sorrowful gesture. "I have brought you such pain,
and&mdash;I can't help!" His hands clenched for a second,
the low voice for a second caressed her. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
I will come back if you wish me to. I can promise
you to come back."</p>

<p>Her eyes darkened. "Promise!" she bade him
fiercely. "Promise&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>But he was silent. It seemed that he was determined
to get Sard out of this mood, to hold her to
her best self, the steady clear-sighted self he had
seen.</p>

<p>"I do want you to," breathed Sard without shame.
"I have grown used to you&mdash;&mdash;" stammering. There
was no immediate answer.</p>

<p>She peered at the tall form standing in the summer
night almost curiously. They had seemed to change
places, Colter and she. Once she had protected, reassured,
stimulated and encouraged a weak and sickly
man. Now, what was it that encircled, that from his
gentle but firmly disciplined presence, dominated
her?</p>

<p>"I think you must have grown better, stronger,"
faltered the girl. She had a kind of childish awe.
"You seem different!"</p>

<p>The dark figure moved toward her. "I am different!"
He breathed a little more rapidly. "I
found a letter&mdash;an old letter stuck into a small Greek
book I had, and there were names, places that I remembered.
It brought back things&mdash;people."</p>

<p>The man's voice suddenly sank into a bottomless
pit of thronging memories. He stirred, and took a
step toward her, holding out his hand. She put hers
quickly into it. The ardent, generous action seemed
again to make him a man of inflexible control, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
held the hand only a moment, raised it to his lips,
kissed it and then gently put it down.</p>

<p>"You have always trusted me? You have always
known me?" he asked in a sort of wonder.</p>

<p>"I have always known what you were inside your
soul better than you knew yourself," she returned
vividly. And as the sensitive long face turned on her,
"I knew that you were <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"If there were time," he answered, "I could tell
you what that letter has brought back,&mdash;names, events,
associations, a college, but which college I don't
know, and outside, some sorrowful things, some
shadow that brought my Night. What that shadow
is I don't know, and until I am sure it is no shadow
on my own life I must not come to you, my dear. I
mustn't come to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>Colter, an indescribable strength on his face, added,
"But outside of that, your father thinks, naturally,
that I am unworthy, but I am sure I am worthy of
you, as worthy as any man may be! Oh, things keep
coming back, coming back!"</p>

<p>From the man's voice one could see that these
things that came back were a veritable tide of joy
and anguish, but that in any case they were life and
sanity.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with uncontrolled tenderness, he moved
to her side. "Sard, child, you belong to me," he said
gently. She could hear this man's breath, his heart
plunging in his chest. She almost waited to be swept
to him, to be lost in him, but that did not come. Un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>der
his voice and look lay judgment, a guidance that
calmed all their passion.</p>

<p>Colter took both her hands; he looked into her
quivering face. "I was hungry and ye took me in,"
he said brokenly, "a stranger and ye ministered unto
me."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. The crickets clicked
their little time devices; the stars were long ropes of
flowers; the trees, in great shapes of withheld tenderness,
shadowed and shut them in; and in the little
gray fruit orchard a girl's spirit felt its wings brush
against another spirit. A girl's courage and fineness
leaned with a great gratitude against a firmness and
fineness greater than its own.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div class="center">SUSPICION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Shipman</span>, after the conclusion of the trial of Terry
O'Brien, spent most of the time chopping wood.
Trees that had been felled during the spring he sawed
into lengths. Splitting and piling into neat kindling
not only kept his muscles elastic, but somehow, as the
wood piles mounted, gave him a primal sense of the
old pioneers' fight against the cold and winter. That
this wood found its way to the house of a needy widow
with a little peaked boy about Pudge's age was one
of Shipman's satisfactions. Long afterward, in the
winter, the lawyer would wake of cold nights and
think of the wind howling around the little valley
house and of the center of heat that fed by his hands
made it possible for two helpless people to escape that
other awful Hand of Cold.</p>

<p>To souls like Watts, intent upon some high conception
of honor and goodness, bent upon making themselves
into a fit home for the Spirit or some part of
Spirit that possesses them, there come moments of
awful despair and groping. The lawyer, sawing until
his back burned with sore muscles, was knowing this
despair to its utmost, for the golden currents, the
flowered tides of the Hudson River summer had
nearly swamped him. The last weeks on the mountain
top had been as those of a starving man sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>rounded
with fruits and delicious spicy drinks&mdash;the
bleak sense of failure, of dusty loneliness, of hurrying
years and barren paths&mdash;his dry desert had opened
out before him!</p>

<p>The man, with unutterable sense of hungry flesh
and spirit, knew himself as one who inevitably had
gotten into a barren trail. His inner eyes, panic
stricken, got the strange vision of an ending&mdash;a going-out-of-the-world
with no continuing strain of him
left behind. No eyes that should be torched from his
eyes; no lips that should turn his stuff of life into
better words; no hand that like his should seek in
darkness to find the keys to human breasts; no wife-comrade
to speak comrade-words in the dark of loneliness
and bafflement; no home that should make the
abiding spot in a shifting world; no child; no race;
no blood sent forward; no continuing city.</p>

<p>Shipman, halting with the perspiration streaming
down his bare back, drew on a sweater. "Dear old
Bowwow"&mdash;the lawyer sat down on his usual log.
He pulled the dog over to him. "Tuck, let me pour
this last howl into your comfortable and safe ear,
and then I'm done. I'm haunted, old chap, haunted
with a horrible feeling of ending&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I want
to go on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see, Tuck, old beggar, I'm getting old, and
when I die there will be no little chap or little sister
Shipman to carry on the soul of me, yes, even the
foolishnesses of me; I suppose," Watts inquired of
his dog, "I suppose you have lots of little puppies
somewhere, some blue-ribboned and with kennel de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>grees
that make you pretty proud? But me, Tuck, I
don't leave anything, not even a little adopted puppy.
Nothing can laugh and say, 'My father was an awful
duffer, but he made good salad dressing,' or 'My
father licked me once, but we used to go fishing together.'
Tuck," whispered the man fiercely, "I want
a son, a little young 'un to keep alive the things I
dream and hope and believe. I want another me."</p>

<p>The strong fingers in the dog's shaggy hair gripped
upon the hateful idea of utter cessation of being, as
many another has gripped. Let those who rage
against Birth Control face rather this mystery of the
man or woman who because of an ideal in the matter
of human love dies without issue! Here is a Birth
Control of much larger and more significant reach.</p>

<p>"The strange part of it is, Tuck, it's easy enough
to get children, but to get children who shall, no matter
what befalls them, be parented by high human love
and faith, that is another thing." The deep eyes
stared into the shallow dog eyes. "Well," sighed
Shipman, "it's very seldom that I care like this. It's
the beginning of autumn, that's all. You don't suppose,
Tuck, that I really care?"</p>

<p>Yet the man knew remorselessly that in the past
week things had happened about which he unutterably
cared. The chance mingling with the young life of the
Willow Roads had shown him to himself in a way
that he could not ignore or brush aside. He was a
human man, a soul and body undeveloped, unrealized,
inorientate in the great human plan. He had blown,
like life seed, down the dry roads of philosophy and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>trospection,
and had lain for a while by the springs
of youth and action until some hidden principle within
him had germinated. Now he craved direction,
fruition!</p>

<p>There floated through the mind of the lawyer the
pictures of Minga, with her vivid capricious demands
on him, her unwitting tempting of him; what would
another man have done? Of what worth were his
hesitations and restraints, Sard, with her high compulsions
and swift fires? Why should he, Shipman,
have let these fresh wonders of womanhood flit by
like shadows? He groaned, knowing why&mdash;because
do what he would, think what he would, Eleanor Ledyard
held him. The woman of ice, the enshrined
mystery of woman whom another man had called
"wife," but who, Shipman believed, had never been
true soul-wife, controlled his, Shipman's, deepest, most
inaccessible self.</p>

<p>Of course, what had come to him was his own
choice. There were many ways a man might take to
come to grips with active life. Cowardly men, sly
men or men who had not thought the thing out had
taken these ways. Cynical men took them and then
wondered why their lives were forever hurt by
smirched and bleared life pictures, pictures that stayed
in their minds. The ways of such men were not for
him. Passion in its highest, most superb moments,
Shipman knew himself to be capable of, but devotion,
tenderness, the fair way of the approach of men and
women to each other's mystery was what his nature
craved. His love principle was not that of a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
moment of gratification. It was of the long, slow
endeared proving of devotion. Plunged in thought,
driven to his body's uttermost endurance with the
sense of stirred, hungry, unsatisfied, uncompleted
things, the lawyer at a footfall angrily raised his head.</p>

<p>"Curse it, can't I be alone?" demanded Watts unreasonably.
"Get out, will you?" He did not turn
his head. "Get out," he called curtly. "This is
private property; can't you read the signs?"</p>

<p>The footfall paused and a voice came quietly, "I
am Colter, Judge Bogart's man. Could you see me a
few moments?"</p>

<p>With a smothered word the lawyer turned, smiling
at his own rudeness, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"I thought it was some Curiosity Bump climbing
up here. I'm not at all sure this sort of life is good
for one. It makes one want to hog the very air."
Watts, still smiling, looked keenly into the eyes of his
visitor. Suddenly he glanced about him for Friar
Tuck. "Well, by all pedigreed pups," he breathed,
"Tuck viséd you, did he? Let you pass? If he
barked, I didn't hear him."</p>

<p>Colter, taking the cigarette from the case held out
to him, returned the searching gaze straightly. It was
Shipman's method to put any who sought him out instantly
on a harmonious social ground. This was
Judge Bogart's hired man. It was also Sard's protégé,
but more than that it was Shipman's private enigma.
The situation was tense with possibilities for both men.
Colter answered without self-consciousness.</p>

<p>"Dogs don't always bark at everyone." He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
thoughtful for a moment. Lighting the cigarette and
pushing the match end under his worn canvas shoe,
he remarked simply, "The only dogs I can remember
barking at me are the shepherd dogs of Greece. And,"
laughingly indicating the little village up the river,
"the dogs of Morris when I was tramping it."</p>

<p>Watts, rolling his own cigarette, looked up idly.</p>

<p>"You've been in Greece?" As he asked the question,
the lawyer, by what process of intuition he himself
could not understand, anticipated the answer.
"Excavating?"</p>

<p>Colter nodded. "I think I was with the American
School at Athens for a year or two. It would seem
that I had some little knowledge about soils." He
hesitated in the curious way with which all who had
known him had grown familiar. The intense fire-blue
eyes concentrated on the placid river as on some
clouded crystal of his opaque past. He seemed curiously
like a fisherman watching for some bite of
memory on his tremulous reaching line, lifting the
empty hook time and again.</p>

<p>"Soils," remarked the regardful lawyer, "must
have their own poetry."</p>

<p>The other hesitated, then as if quite forgetful where
he was or on what errand he had come, Colter responded
evenly, "They have an interest like that of
a profound book, quite outside of what one assays
or digs for. There are enough adventures in soils
right around this Hudson River section back through
the states of New York and New Jersey to make an
Iliad."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hum." Shipman inhaled his cigarette smoke,
which flowed through his deep nostrils; with a curious
lowering of the eyelids over the profound dark of his
eyes, he let one hand drop loosely over his knee. It
was the lawyer's instinctive relaxed indifferent pose
of listening and watching; listening for false voice
tones, watching for shifting glimmers and lights of
evasion and deceit, for the curious betrayal in eyelids
and lip muscles.</p>

<p>"Soils, however, would hardly recommend themselves
as exciting to the average man."</p>

<p>The other man smiled for a second and glanced at
the lawyer with a free relish of the subject. "They
say young men need occasional wars to stimulate their
sense of adventure." The quiet voice was ironical,
and Colter waved a disparaging hand. "This river,"
he said; "think of the poetry and adventure of the
great minds born on its banks. Think of the poetry
and adventure for science and enterprise still to come
along its banks as a great Water Road," he indicated
a slow train of freight cars on the opposite shore,
"and as one of the great verses in the Odyssey of
Trade. Why, leaving out the Poem of Hauling, I
suspect that back of these hills there are important
contributions to history and geology and art. There
must be Indian burying grounds filled with the half
ossified Indian chiefs, their pottery and tribal implements."
Colter, leaning on his arms, apparently lost
in some pleasant fancy of his own, smoked dreamily.
"To find these things is better adventure than plunging
a bayonet into another man's stomach," he smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>Shipman's eyes, however, remained half closed.
This was all very pretty. The chap had perhaps been
a soldier, and attended a military school. He might
have taken courses as a war engineer. Yet a clever
cracksman or modern safe technician would get up a
long lingo like this, especially if he wanted to "put
something over," to sound the mental habits, resources
and association of the other man, catalogue them for
some confidence scheme of his own. Watts crossed
one leg over the other and smoked at the sky. His back
was to the river which the other man sat facing. His
frequent sharp looks were swift and incisive. So far
the lawyer had made no effort to find out Colter's
errand. There was all the time in the world; meanwhile
there was a girl down there with a girl's romantic
sense of faith and belief in this man, probably a
farceur and trickster. It might be his, Shipman's,
bitter job to have to go to this girl as her friend and
tell her the truth.</p>

<p>"I can see that you take a good deal of interest in
such things." Then, not without some marveling on
the part of the lawyer, the two plunged into an absorbed
discussion of seeps and sheds, of green marl
and sandstone, of clay gravel and sand, of mineral
waters and sources of potash and phosphates, the
problems of tunneling and boring, the opening up of
this and that manufacture and industry, the prophecies
of latent oils and resins and cements.</p>

<p>The lawyer, thoroughly enjoying it, yet obstinately
fancied that he sensed some insecurity, some too-varied
mingling of knowledge back of it. So, he told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
himself, might any high-powered confidence man give
the right answers and take the right cues. There were
books nowadays, compendiums of knowledge. Just
reading modern advertisements made a man's mind
agile and slick.</p>

<p>"So you've been in Greece." Shipman was watchful,
at the same time smoothly disarming. He gently
flicked the ashes from his cigarette. "You must know
Gnossus, Crete, Andritsena, and, let's see," warily,
"the name of that mountain temple that the French-man
discovered."</p>

<p>Colter's face lightened enthusiastically. "Bassae."
He looked interestedly into the lawyer's face. The
other paused a few moments.</p>

<p>"You remember such things?" remarked the lawyer
significantly.</p>

<p>"Yes," with eagerness, "I do. The Greek hasn't
gotten away from me." Colter looked almost happily
into Shipman's face. "A great deal comes back
along academic lines," he faltered.</p>

<p>"Um!" Shipman tossed away his cigarette. He
did not light another. He loafed against the back of
the tree, his fingers lightly and speculatively tapping
on his little silver match-box, his lips half whistling
while his mind ran over possible and probable things.
He reviewed everything he had ever seen of Colter,
particularly the man's eyes that day on the Hackensack,
looking into his own with their look of appeal,
"Who am I?" Very gently, without turning his
head, with voice unemotional, undramatic, the lawyer
now asked his own question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you? Why do you conceal who you
are?"</p>

<p>Colter, who had as he talked been dreamily staring
at the river, sprang quickly back to an attitude of attention.
Every motion he made, every slightest movement
of hand or eyelash or the corners of lips, was
under a remorseless observation, that of a genius for
reading human beings.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" The question was repeated very
quietly, but now it had the note of inexorable authority.
It was asked on behalf of Sard, whose trusting
face and figure made it on Shipman's lips, stern, uncompromising.</p>

<p>Colter, his face flushing, rose. The man had
changed in a deadly sort of way. His head from
which he had removed the cap sunk suddenly forward
as if his face could not look into that old enigma
"Who am I?" The hair, swept back in its curious
boy-like wave, was of vital copper under which Shipman
noted a very few gray hairs which seemed curiously
premature for the face opposite. The white
skin, slightly freckled, had a youthful, good modeling;
the face bones made it of pure English build. Shipman,
puzzled, tried to analyze the curious look of
sorrow and patient suffering on it. His gaze went to
one or two very small scars as of smallpox.</p>

<p><i>One or two very small scars, as of smallpox!</i> The
lawyer stared at the white teeth showing under a
mustached lip set to a gaunt look of bravery and mental
struggle.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said the other, "I had for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>gotten&mdash;forgotten
myself. You treated me like a
friend, and I went along easily. Things came easily&mdash;I
was remembering," Colter sat up, his hands
working at his belt. "Things came to me, but," he
shook his head, "you ask who I am."</p>

<p>The man turned the old mask of suffering on his
interlocutor and shook his head. If the thing was
acting, it was prodigious acting. Shipman told himself
that such acting had gotten Sard's soul away
from her. It should not, however, have her entire!
That face with its strange look of sorrow suddenly
maddened the lawyer. He straightened. This mask
must be torn off. This charlatan must be shown up.
Now an old vulpine habit of the court-room came on
the legal face.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Shipman thrust his chin forward
in a curious wolfish way; his mouth grinned while his
eyes stared implacably. It was the old terrorizing
third degree method. The method of which the lawyer
in his better moments was secretly ashamed, but
on which he knew any human reserve could be broken.
Watts Shipman, with a kind of battle scent, felt himself
to be pitted against something too shrewd, too
delicately perceptive and elusive, to respond to other
methods. And, well, the lawyer was not accustomed
to being beaten at his own game! His glance, like a
look of dreadful night, a look of knowledge of all
human hiding, turned on the man. It was as if with
incandescent power he would trace the very vitals, sift
the fugitive thought and judgment, drive to the wall
all subterfuges, snap handcuffs on the very shadow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the eyes, see the very juices and chemistry of the
living, breathing soul and body before him.</p>

<p>"<i>Who are you?</i>"</p>

<p>The other man, with a man's defiance, some dignity
and assurance as of bygone things, had risen. "Of
course, you had a right to ask that," he said slowly.
"But I wish you had not because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;" He
passed his hand wearily over his forehead. "It is
hard for me to keep things clear, to go straight ahead.
I came up to you here to ask for work."</p>

<p>"To ask for work?"</p>

<p>"I hoped," said Colter simply, "that you could give
me some suggestion. Judge Bogart has asked me to
leave."</p>

<p>In the silence that followed the lawyer tried to keep
intense curiosity and anxiety from his eyes. Involuntarily
Sard's name came to his lips. Stealing a
look at the other man, he felt that Colter would also
lock his uncertain lips on that name.</p>

<p>On the pause the flood of intelligence that swept
through the lawyer brought obstinate anger and resentment.
"Hog," he breathed as once before,
"hog!" He could see Sard's wild dismay, her sense
of shame as of someone who had been untrustworthy,
the poor child's friendlessness. "Hog," said the lawyer
in the bitter back room of his mind, "animal!"</p>

<p>Yet was not the Judge, the father of the girl, right?
Could a man who knew the world allow a thing so
radiantly impulsive her instinctive freedoms with an
interloper, a rapscallion, someone who dodged on his
tracks, played a worn-out game of ignorance as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
his own identity, the responsibility he had in the
world?</p>

<p>"Who are you?" repeated Shipman steadily. Then
as a thought struck him, "Why did Judge Bogart ask
you to leave?" The lawyer bethought himself of the
"word test" in psycho-analysis. What word would
make this fellow change, cringe, become maudlin, explanatory?</p>

<p>There was a short silence until the other man replied
calmly, "I should prefer not going into that."</p>

<p>Suddenly, to the lawyer's enormous surprise, a curious
thing happened. Colter, after taking a few nervous
steps back and forth, came up to him, holding out
his hand, and with an air almost winning in its friendliness,
said, "Good-bye, I'm sorry I bothered. You
see, I hoped you could help me to get work. If not,
I must go."</p>

<p>The lawyer studied him. "What kind of work?"
he asked curtly.</p>

<p>"Any kind to get food and lodging while I wait."</p>

<p>"Wait for what?"</p>

<p>"For things to come back to me," said Colter simply.
"I think things are beginning to get clearer.
Just now when we talked," he waved his hand, "doors
opened all around me. I felt myself back in myself.
The true me&mdash;I&mdash;you see, I am in much better health."</p>

<p>The man stood there irresolute, the eyes wavering
in their intensity of attempted remembrance, some
look of assurance and confidence alternating with the
old shifting look of dread and dismay that at moments
still swept the fine drawn face. It was this look of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
shifting dread that had always kept the lawyer suspicious.
What had this man done that could give to
strong eyes like that the averted haunted look they
sometimes held? His manner changing with a half
apologetic smile, he turned to his visitor.</p>

<p>"I take it you've been a scientific man, college-bred.
Have you by any chance a degree?" Shipman almost
laughed as he asked it.</p>

<p>The other knit his brows, and returned the look
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Would you believe me if&mdash;if I tell you what I
have come to believe, what I think is possible, would
you think me crazy?"</p>

<p>Then a slow sense of what had been of the man's
horror dawned on the lawyer. "If amnesia were
true, if one were dimly conscious of one's life paths
and had somehow, somewhere been swept out of these
paths, and there were no landmark to help one go
back, why then," the grim mouth shut on the doubts.
Shipman nodded. There was something in the nod
that the other man in his helpless gentleness comprehended.
The nod said, "I don't believe you. I don't
trust you, but I won't take advantage of you." It was
hardly akin to Sard's whole-souled trust.</p>

<p>One arm crossed behind him, Colter began pacing
restlessly up and down the small space where the tree-chopping
and wood-sawing had made a little theatre.
He spoke rapidly, disconnectedly. "I have come to
believe that I have been a college man. I even believe
that I have had certain honors. There have been
achievements along scientific lines. I can so far re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>member
nothing in sequence back of the day Miss
Bogart found me. Since that I have a perfect power
of memory." The man halted and seemed to wait with
a strained patience for things to pour in on the open
sensitive plate of his healing memory. At last, fishing
in an inner pocket, he held out a little book bound in
green vellum. It was very worn and had evidently
been constantly read. "I have always had this book,
wherever I have been. For months it was the one
real thing. It was here, tucked back in a sort of
envelope in the cover, that a week ago I found an old
letter from a man I once knew. When I try to connect
my memories with this man something profoundly
horrible sweeps me, and&mdash;and I grow full of panic."</p>

<p>Watts, with suspicions he could not control, reached
out for the book. At the same time he looked for
anything that might further identify this mysterious
Colter. He peered almost with anger into a face so
fine and tempered in its sad look of opaque visions.
Turning the opening leaves, Shipman read in the little
book, "Oxford, December 25, 19&mdash;to M. L. from his
fellow gypsy, Tarrant."</p>

<p>"Tarrant. Tarrant," the name arrested the lawyer.
He turned sobered eyes upon Colter. "Who is Tarrant?"
he asked. Watts, with an annoyed expression,
wrinkled his brows. Where in thunder had he
heard that name Tarrant?</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Colter, "yet somehow, I believe
it is someone I have known."</p>

<p>Suddenly, as in a lovely picture, the man saw a
June garden with the Ramapo Mountains back of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
He saw distant daisy fields, a little white gate, the tall
wands of purple and blue canterbury bells; a little boy
sat cutting out paper dolls and a woman, whose dark
blue eyes were shy with him and whose voice had
faltered as she had told him a story and who had
shown him a picture in a locket that she had drawn
up warm from her white breast. The woman's voice
was always dreamily in Shipman's memory. Now it
told him a story.</p>

<p>The story of a West African expedition that had
ended fatally, disastrously, where the men died like
sheep of smallpox, where George Ledyard's brother,
the famous biologist, Martin Ledyard, had striven for
the lives of the men, but had only been able to save
three. Then Dr. Ledyard had rowed down the tropical
river with the body of his dearest friend, the
surgeon, Tarrant, in a canoe made from a hollow tree.
The natives, having deserted them, had left the scientific
party without canoes. Tarrant, Martin Ledyard's
dearest friend, his brother-in-science!</p>

<p>There was a long silence before the lawyer looked
up into the face of that man who walked up and
down, his russet head erect, one arm crossed behind
him on his back. Colter's face, absorbed, earnest,
rational, had yet that curious look of hesitancy and
bafflement that the lawyer began to know was the
thing in which he had always disbelieved, the thing he
had scouted, amnesia. The lawyer's knowledge of
shell-shock, of trance, of the results of profound and
tragic sorrow, served him now. He could no longer
repudiate this evident spiritual and mental submersion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>But what would cause amnesia, apart from trying
physical conditions? Not even horrible experiences
in West African jungles with one's friends dying consecutively
of smallpox. The loss of a man's friend?
Not altogether. Illness, exposure? Not altogether.
Shock? <i>Shock?</i></p>

<p>Watts Shipman, plunged in thought, searched in
his imagination for the one shock that might have
shut the doors of memory. Colter, looking patiently
at him, hazarded a suggestion.</p>

<p>"That book," motioning to it, "that book is a sort
of talisman. Sometimes it brings back whole sequences
of memory, and then that letter that you see
speaks of men of science, who are living to-day, as if
I and the writer had known them together."</p>

<p>Watts laughed, and turned away with something
like a sneer.</p>

<p>"Awfully clever, old chap. I've no doubt you've
done this successfully many times, but," the lawyer
turned abruptly, "I have seen a good deal, you know."
Sharply, "Now drop all this memory-camouflage.
Tell me who you are, why you're here, what knocked
you out, and I'll give you any old job you want&mdash;come,"
said Watts authoritatively. "You've been a
cultivated man, no doubt about that. You've traveled;
you're a 'has-been'! You've come a cropper some
way&mdash;drink, dope, women," he looked narrowly into
the still white face. "Some disgrace, perhaps some
tragedy&mdash;you're ashamed of something."</p>

<p>It was so brutal, so abrupt, that it had its immediate
result. There was a long and very curious si<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>lence.
It was as if the two men staring at each
other had been fighting a secret fight under the open
one of incredulity and effort to reveal. Both of them
under the threshold of intelligence knew what that secret
fight was. It was Sard! All harmony had vanished.
Something hard and unlovely had taken its
place. It was as if the two worked desperately to
create a wall between them and the wall was now
finished. It was an inevitable wall of a girl's fresh
vibrant personality.</p>

<p>But Colter, without emotion, with a murmured
apology for having intruded, turned to go. "Perhaps
I was mistaken," he said, his face and voice controlled
as usual. He had the usual and somewhat helpless
courtesy of one unable to fight with another man's
weapons of prestige and tradition. But on the riven,
sorrow-lined face was an expression of forbearance
and pure masculine sweetness such as only fine habits
and lofty associations can create. He held out his
hand. "Thank you for giving me your time," he said
gravely.</p>

<p>Friar Tuck came nosing along the ground, following
up some poem of scent of which he had begun the
first verse at five <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> Shipman, his hand reaching
out for the dog's devoted head, dug deep into
the heavy neck fur. Something on the lawyer's face
was torn and of queer struggle. He stood there tousling
the dog, letting his own body be half swayed this
way and that by the slight playful fracas. Suddenly
the dark-browed lawyer looked up at the retreating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
figure. He scowled horribly. "Damn it!" he called
out explosively, "damn it! Stay where you are!"</p>

<p>At the other's surprised pause, his look of inquiry,
Shipman strode forward. He held out his own hand.
"Shake." He made the strange awkward picture of
ultimate manhood, of the true warrior type who vanquishes
himself before any other enemy. The man
who will not stand out against the assault of a finer
soul. "Colter," said the lawyer sharply, "I'm an
ass, a cad, and you are a gentleman."</p>

<p>At the slight quick color on the other's face, Shipman
stumbled doggedly on. "Yes, sir, I'll be hanged
if I can believe that about the amnesia. I never saw
any and I never had any, and I haven't got in all the
evidence yet, but I know one thing. You are a gentleman&mdash;curse
it!" said the lawyer standing there. "If
you mustn't think me a yellow dog&mdash;now," said Shipman,
standing straight, his professional manner returning,
his hands on Tuck's neck, "I've been observing
something and remembering some things and
I can't help wondering&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was very little answering interest in the other's
face. The wall was still between them, and Colter,
some idea driving him, was for getting away.
Seeing this, the lawyer, with an inevitable boyish sense
of coup, hastily pulled a wallet from the pocket of
his coat lying on a log. Taking a long newspaper
clipping from it, he placed it before the other's eyes.
"Do you know that face?" he asked eagerly. There
was a cut of a man's head in the article.</p>

<p>Colter gravely took the clipping. Then, as he read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the headline, he seemed to shrink. His intense blue
eyes in awful inquiry went to Shipman's.</p>

<p>"<i>George Ledyard Forges and Embezzles.</i>" The
man stood there a long while, the paper dropping in
his hand. He read no more; his dry lips worked;
once or twice he passed his hand over his face. At
last, "That is what I saw on the steamer," he muttered
slowly. "I saw this heading on the wireless bulletin
on the steamer in which I was coming home. It made
me ill. I was already weak, had fever. I went to my
cabin and can remember no more." Suddenly Colter
looked at the lawyer. "You will have to help me,"
he began in a firm voice; "things are rushing in on
me. Tarrant; my brother's death, dishonor, the hospital.
I got away from the hospital&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;help me,"
beseeched Colter thickly. He staggered, both hands
out toward the lawyer. "I must keep my head clear.
I can't let things sweep in too fast. I must keep my
head clear," groaned the man. "Oh, for her sake, for
her sake," he muttered. "Don't you see&mdash;for her
sake!"</p>

<p>The man stared with silent appeal. The strong tides
of memory poured through his eyes. With hands
desperately tossed up, with a body that seemed to
snap under one groan, he fell unconscious at Shipman's
feet.</p>

<div class="center">THE PERCEPTIONS OF MINGA</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "explosive dust" of the Trout County court-room
had not yet subsided. Two young heads had
not yet bowed before the final judgments of the law.
After a week of mysterious communings, sudden hidings
of and exchanges of letters, a series of hidden
glances and specially planned conferences, Dunstan
and Minga announced at the breakfast table one
morning that they would take the green car and be
gone all day. They carefully did not state where they
were going and no one dreamed the dramatic character
of their plans.</p>

<p>The rest of the family received the news without
comment, the Judge merely remarking:</p>

<p>"Wash the car before you use it, and pay for your
own gas."</p>

<p>Dunstan received these orders with benevolent understanding.
"Well said," he approved his father impudently;
with lifted eyebrows he grimaced at Sard.</p>

<p>"We miss our good friend Colter," he murmured.
"There was a fine literary washer of cars. I mind me
of the splendid hexameters that rolled from the amnesian
lips while he applied himself to the mud-guards."
The dancing eyes questioned his sister's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
face. The Judge's watchful look went also to this
face, but there was no book for the world to read.</p>

<p>At whatever cost to her own hunger for sympathy
the girl, sitting at the coffee urn, in Miss Aurelia's
temporary absence, had the absorbed air of the knight
who prays beside armor. For Sard was devising
pathetic, youthful armors of self-control and wisdom.
Her world could not share her belief nor be with her
in her ardent things, therefore she would keep these
ardent things bright and enshrined in her own lonely
heart.</p>

<p>Colter had said, "I will come back." Sard, her
being thrilling at the words, had dared to whisper,
"Promise&mdash;promise!" She was so ashamed, so thankful
for that daring now! Want him? The silent girl
there dared not tell herself how she wanted him, could
not put even into secret words the tremulous ecstasy
of this wanting. Outside of her, curious faces like
Dunstan's and Minga's and Miss Aurelia's and the
Judge's looked at her own absorbed face and disapproved
or were tolerant. It was nothing. Sard
saw them as a person standing in a soft firelit, flower-bright
room sees faces passing in profile on a cold
street.</p>

<p>Dunstan's comment was made <i>sotto voce</i>, from the
Arabian nights:</p>

<p>"<i>'Fish, Fish, art thou in thy duty?' The fishes
raised their heads and said, 'If you reckon, we
reckon&mdash;'</i>" The youth looked around the breakfast
table amiably as if he expected to be answered in
kind. Receiving no like sallies he pushed his chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and sauntered forth, followed in a few discreet seconds
by Minga. As the two fussed over the car-washing,
low voices discussed beside their own plan
the whole problem of the Man on the Place.</p>

<p>"It's the real thing for Con Sordino, I guess," Dunstan
sighed. "Gosh, suppose the duffer is a confidence
man or a bigamist? The papers have such every
day; their kind always gets amnesia when convenient,"
the boy sighed; "sort of rotten to have your own
sister go nuts on a Wandering Willy. I wonder."
The lad turning on the hose, softly whistled. Minga
giggled.</p>

<p>"It's so funny," she declared, "as if Sard sort of
thought Colter would turn to a prince if you only
waved the right wand."</p>

<p>"No, it's not that; she really saw a prince or something
like that in him," the brother declared. "Sard's
like that when she looks at anybody, Minga; she
doesn't see an ordinary flapper, like you; she sees a
future stateswoman, a fearless fighter for the good,
the true, the pure, the thing that might be." Dunstan
was only half flippant.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Minga was awed. "But say,
about Colter. I went up to that room after he left, the
room over the garage, and will you believe it, I found
Sard there. She was sitting queer and still and in her
hand she had a book she'd lent him. Well, my word,"
said Minga violently, "it was the awfulest old scientific
flubdub, first causes, am&oelig;bas and protoplasms, all
those out-of-date things."</p>

<p>"Yep, all the hogwash; they still print it," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Dunstan. "That was the old fellow's line, always
chewing at those bones the old guy was; self-made-man-stuff,
y' know."</p>

<p>The girl groaned. "Don't I hate it! We had it at
college, so of course I'm through it all. You going to
cram your two last years with that sawdust?" inquired
Minga.</p>

<p>The washer of automobiles ceased his sponging of
the long green body. Dunstan stood, brown-shirted
sleeves rolled up, young head hot and tumbled, eye
bright and discriminating.</p>

<p>"No, Grandma," he turned promptly, "I am not.
I cram on facts. See? I cut out all the frills and
monkey and snail lore, and I root around just enough
Latin and mathematics to look good to the old-timers.
All I want is a diploma. See, so's I can walk into
any chap's office and call him Bill and look him in his
Pie Rooky Beta Kipper eye and say, 'Now then, my
young Arabian Nights Oil Pasha, I may look like the
One-eyed Calendar, but I've got the same world-series,
all-American learning you've got, and I don't propose
to be kicked out of this office till I get what I came
for, see?' That," said Dunstan mopping his brow, "is
my idea of education."</p>

<p>Minga nodded. "You sure do need an education
in business," the girl agreed thoughtfully. "I know
the Mede keeps saying that if he had his choice he'd
give up his income and keep his brains, but not me,"
said serious Minga. "What use would my brains be
to me if I hadn't an income?"</p>

<p>"You gotter have brains all right," said Dunstan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
"and then you've gotter forget you got 'em or that
anybody else has 'em. Look at the after-dinner
speeches, you know that rot, and the political ones, all
done by famous men; don't they prove that brains are
only a side-show? You just have 'em, but when you
get there you don't use 'em. That's the idea."</p>

<p>The bobbed head leaning seriously by the side of the
cropped one to swab the runners considered seriously
these things.</p>

<p>Finally Minga announced, "Say, while I'm speaking
of deep things and all, I'm going home next week.
After we snitch Terry from jail I'm done!"</p>

<p>Dunstan looked at her sagely. He stood up,
stretched, and eyed his friend with increasing disapproval.
"Pshaw, that's a new kind of slush; what
have you got, indigestion? Go home, nothing. Why,
after the Terry rescue&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Minga rubbed solemnly on the running-board; her
friend looked alarmed.</p>

<p>"You have not got to go home! What do the
Mede and Persian care as long as you're where they
can send you day-letters and telephones. No, ma'am,
you've got to stay here in this house of the seven
sleepers and nobody-to-wash-cars, you've got to stay
here and sass the governor and shock Aunt Reely and
keep Sard from eloping with the iceman and once
in a while, for deviltry, hold my hand. That's what
you've got to do."</p>

<p>The boyish faun-like face smiled belligerently, but
Dunstan's eyes had subtle anxiety. "You haven't
really to go?" he inquired. "Aw come on, can't you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
start a new sweater and say you can't go home till
you've finished it? I've seen many a girl work that
dodge," remarked Dunstan. "On account of this being
the only place you can match the wool," he nodded
acutely.</p>

<p>Minga stood pulling down her belt. She gave the
bobbed head a resolute shake. "I'm going," she said.
She stood there, a curious little picture of untried
resolution. "I don't know exactly what's come over
me," the girl confessed. "I've nothing against you,
Dunce; you've been a real sweet idiot, and I'm going
to see us through the Terry rescue, but after the
Terry rescue," said Minga in a solemn tone, "home
I've got to go." She hesitated a moment adding,
"Anyway, after that, you see, Judgie will hate me and
turn me out and Aunt Reely will be nervous and Sard
will be queer and gloomy and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anyway I'll be annoying," said Dunstan obstinately,
"the way I've been right along."</p>

<p>There was a long silence for this talkative pair. At
last:</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Minga, "I sort of see things different.
I can't seem to want to visit around as much
as I used. I'm going home to be a daughter, that sort
of thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, deliver us!" groaned Dunstan. "Oh my
soul! Say, what's the matter, girl, didn't your last
allowance come? Nobody's a daughter nowadays; it
isn't done. Say, Minga, this is awful! Anyway&mdash;don't
go!"</p>

<p>Minga stood first on one foot, then on the other. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
her mind, a little dazed and haunted by recent events,
still rang Shipman's summing up of her after their
various encounters, and the final night at the dance.
The lawyer had held the two tantalizing hands very
tightly and murmured, "You are a very dear little
thing, a very dear little thing." He had said it with
a sort of tortured groan. Minga was beginning to
realize with a good deal of slow pain how a man might
resolutely hold a girl like her away from himself and
herself, from something to which, the girl was clever
enough to know, she had half unconsciously tried to
lure him. The sentence with its tender repudiation of
her had penetrated to something honest in her heart.
Then had come the morning outside the court-house
when Shipman had defined life to them. The older
man's power, his penetrating analysis, had somehow
reached to the soul that lay dormant, the little butterfly
character had sleepily stirred, the little blue egg
had broken, and Minga, a scared soul, looked forth
upon a universe that had a spiritual endlessness. Some
new dim sense of men came to her, not as strong
creatures that must be made silly slaves to women or
played upon by light motives, but as loyal brothers
who had enormous power of strength or suffering
through women. Watts Shipman's world of standards
and honor stood out to her like a strange austere
country of mountains and looming towers as to which
she was supremely curious, but into which her feet
hardly knew how to tread.</p>

<p>Minga looked earnestly at Dunstan's back. "You
see," she worked this out as she had once worked it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
out with Sard, "you see, Dunce, whether we like it or
not, we've got to get busy, us young ones. It's queer,"
said little Minga with an omniscience not to be despised,
"but though the grown-ups try all they can to
discourage us when we do take hold, they know as
well as we do that we've got to take hold. We," said
Minga, with awed prophecy, "our kind, the Bunches,
don't you know, all over the world. The French
Bunch, like us, the Italian Bunch, the English Bunch,
the flappers of the world. Our Bunches have got to
run the world; it's awful, it's queer, but," the little
bobbed head nodding violently, "it's true; so we ought
to be preparing. The fathers and mothers and aunts
and uncles and things hate to have us take hold before
they tell us what to do. Though you can see," said
Minga solemnly, "that they don't half of them know
what to do themselves. So we have <i>got</i> to take hold."
The bobbed maiden was sober to a terrifying degree.
Dunstan stared at the little mouth that summed up,
"And I suppose for this reason we ought to sort of
brace up and begin to take notice. Now, for instance,"
said Minga with a sudden virtuous decision,
"I've made up my mind that love is divine; I'm not
going to fool any more. Love is divine," announced
Minga.</p>

<p>"Wow!" said Dunstan, "don't hit me there again,
as the lady said."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," returned his car-washing companion
determinedly. "I&mdash;I&mdash;I've grown sick of these petting
parties and all this silly stuff. When you really don't
care you&mdash;you just don't do it, so I'm going to cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
out these fake engagements just to wear different
kinds of rings&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;if love is really divine," said
Minga, she looked half timidly off to the mountain
where the organ builder's house stood, "why, those
petting parties are kind of common; do you get me?"</p>

<p>"Do I get you?" ejaculated Dunstan. "Say," he
straightened up, "if you knew what I knew. Say, I
could tell you things, Minga."</p>

<p>Minga, her resolutions almost overcoming her, sat
down on an upturned box. "I really feel different,"
she said solemnly. "After that night Tawny Troop
bawled me out, and&mdash;and something else happened,
well, I got a sort of different feeling. Now, for instance,"
said Minga, "old people; I don't want to
make fun of them any more. Isn't that queer? I
want to sort of study 'em and see what they mean.
Imagine! I really want," went on Minga in an awed
voice, "to hang around and talk seriously to Judgie,
and&mdash;and queer unnatural things like that. I'm going
to be a daughter and sort of get interested; isn't it
awful?"</p>

<p>Dunstan walked lovingly around his car, trying all
its functions, and cast an appreciative eye on his comrade.
"Good stuff," he commended. "The old birds
must have some sense packed away somewhere. The
old-timers like to beat the air and say things, but they
ain't so low in the grave but what they see a few facts
too.</p>

<p>"Well," the youth stood up straight, hands in
pockets, whistling softly, "the 'Green Bottle' is herself
again, cleaned, curried and coddled. Got that let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>ter?
I'll go in and change my duds, and then I guess
we're ready. What? You got Terry's letter all
right?"</p>

<p>Minga produced the letter; with one eye on the distant
house, the two rereading it together, enjoying the
sense of secrecy, half giggling at the queer spelling
and altogether excited over their plan. The black
round script ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>The gang stops work at five. The guards goes
first to git the truck ready to take us bak to the pen!
If you come threw about that time, I will beat it to
your car and take the chance. Go slow till I jump; if
I catch on, go like hell; go like hell anyways. There
is a curve ahead to the right, but that is what you
want, as the guards got motorcycles. So no more at
present. Give the duck that brings this fifty cents
and oblige</i></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">You Know Who</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>As Minga read, the two young faces suffused with a
thrilled fire; weeks ago at the trial Minga and Dunce
had decided to abduct Terry. The legal aspects of the
thing hardly occurred to them. This sort of thing
was done in the movies successfully, why not in actual
life? Their plan was to snatch the boy from the
road-building gang sent out by the state's prison to
the stone crusher on the Western Shore where road-making
was in progress. Terry was then to be conveyed
in their automobile to the deserted Stone Oven
of Revolutionary fame near Bear Mountain. Here,
where a little stream wandered through the bracken,
he could be driven to every day and supplied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
food until it should be safe to convey him to a night
train and ship him to the West. Minga and Dunce
had worked out the thing with dime novel detail, with
dramatic appreciation of its flavor and dash, until the
project ceased to have its original motive of saving
Terry and gradually became their own twentieth century
private automobile adventure. They had a
charmed sense of thrill and a pleasant feeling of outwitting
such staid and sober folk as Watts Shipman.
It was not at all uncharacteristic of young persons, not
at all uncharacteristic of the time, not at all uncharacteristic
of the laughable enigma of human nature that
at the very moment that the two were starting out to
do something entirely discreditable, inevitably wrong,
that they should be resolving with all the power and
imagination of their young souls to adjust themselves
better to the world they lived in. If it occurred to
Minga and Dunce that as a first step in their new resolutions
the Terry abduction was hardly judicious, they
put the idea aside; each felt committed to the thing;
neither knew how to withdraw.</p>

<p>It was the early July that is still reminiscently June.
Orioles and tanagers were still flashing through the
Hudson River green, rose-breasted grosbeaks and indigo
birds had only just moved on to other mysterious
leafage. The fields and hills were dusted with silver
daisies and amid slopes of feathery grass coreopsis
began to toss golden crowns. Out on the country
roads the deep woods began to show, through their
mystical vistas, tall towered carillons of speckled lily
bells, and mountain laurel tossed pink shells on clumps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
of foam-lit dark. The car whirled along rocky bits of
road where tall plantains, and milkweed and fireweed,
things of orange and rose and scarlet plume burned
along the ditches of water-worn gravel, or by the
lichened gray of ranging stone walls. It all spelled
myriad fecundities, ripe gay plant life, a thousand
dusts and washes of seed, a thousand marchers of
hidden atoms, a thousand caravans and progression of
strange mysterious pollen. The rich Chord of Summer
was resolving throughout the countryside, played by a
hand that goes lovingly back each year to the old hymn
of begetting, and birth, and death! The old, old
hymn of creation that sings us all in and out of being.</p>

<p>A gypsy camp on a rocky hillside back of the road
showed dingy tents, and the tethered horses and empty
hooded wagons stood in a sea of wild roses and buttercups.
The gypsies, rather modern, with a decided
tendency to fireless cookers and hair-nets and graphophones,
were brown and smiling in indolent gypsy
leisure. Minga stared upon them with awe; she dimly
got their Pagan raison d'être, their rising to sunrise,
their sleeping in cold stars and dew; the girl looked
delightedly upon the strong bodies of little, half-naked
children, and though daintily clad herself, she got a
sense of the primal poetry and rags of the vagabond
women who looked not too respectfully out to the
showy car.</p>

<p>"Pretty lady, have your fortune told," called out
one old hag. The gleaming lawless faces said impertinent
lawless things, the teeth glittered, and the eyes
were saucy. Minga was for halting the car and climb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>ing
down for this experience, but her companion restrained
her.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't!" begged Dunstan disgustedly. "Say,
they're fresh. Don't monkey with 'em, they have
diseases, they're always horribly dirty. Don't go near
them," shuddered the boy; "they make me crawl,
somehow."</p>

<p>The old crone sitting by a steaming kettle swung on
a pole looked out to them leeringly. That she could
have heard their comments seemed incredible to the
two in the automobile, but the black gaze seemed to
read their very souls.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;Mates," the old woman called out teasingly,
meaningly, with a curious warning.</p>

<p>"Mates," then as the impudent curious eyes surveyed
them, this woman made a strange gesture, pagan,
clairvoyant and authoritative. "Mates," she
screamed after them, "there's a dead body between
ye; it joins ye, Mates, Mates."</p>

<p>This was too much for Miss Gerould. She of the
pampered and sheltered life. "Oh, my goodness," the
girl gasped. The face under the pretty hat paled.
Minga, who had never before come up against the
raw things of life, grew suddenly faint. The face of
his friend peered up into Dunstan's. "Say, would
you call that a curse?" inquired Minga. "It&mdash;it
sounded awful, Dunce; I believe it was a curse. It
sort of scares me."</p>

<p>The boy laughed. He changed gears. "These people
are awful queer," he admitted; "they do know
things; they're good to keep away from, I think."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>Minga shivered. "But could she make up such
wild things? 'a dead body between ye, joining ye,'
how do they know? They can't know, can they?"</p>

<p>Dunstan shook his head solemnly and the two young
heads for a time cast nervous glances behind them,
for it was a strange happening for a summer day; it
would seem to cast a curious shadow on their adventure.
The boy driver of the "Green Bottle" was
thoughtful for a long time before he said ruminatingly,
slowly, to his companion, "Just the same, they do
know things. Minga, if we slept outdoors always and
found our roads by the stars and noticed the way
bushes grew, and tides, and the moon, and stayed with
just animals and just took life as it is, you know,
without the elevators and cosmetics and electric lights
and hotels and the things that keep us away from life,
just took it straight like a big drink of something powerful,
why, wouldn't we be like that? Wouldn't we
look directly at big things and see them straight, not
wrapped up in tissue paper?"</p>

<p>Dunstan swept his free hand to the fields flowing
by them. "Colter, well, Colter told me an awful lot of
funny things about life and the great laws under it.
Just being good, for instance, you have no idea, Minga,
the great natural laws that lie under just being good."
Dunstan paused. "There were a lot of old guys,
priests and mystics and things that knew these laws,
but we get lost from them, getting rich and all. The
old kind of science got ahead of them and didn't believe
them, but science, nowadays, Colter says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dunstan after a few moments' reflection looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
around at his companion. "Did you hear the old tent-toad
call us 'Mates'?" he asked soberly, "just
'Mates'&mdash;I think she saw something."</p>

<p>Minga was silent.</p>

<p>"Maybe we are mates," said the boy soberly;
"maybe we are, Minga."</p>

<p>The girl at his side bit her lip and her foot tapped
impatiently on the floor. "Now," said Minga, "now
I am not going to be bothered with that stuff." Then,
the vivid color flying into her face, "Dunce, oh, I
will not have it; such nonsense, from a wrinkled old
gypsy." Minga was silent a moment before she
added, "I should think you'd want to forget what she
said, 'a dead body between us, uniting us,' all that."</p>

<p>But Dunstan was looking far ahead along the vista
of the leafy road. He said no more, only as Minga,
sitting back, tried to start up some of their old rallying
songs and sallies the boy kept repeating dreamily, "She
called us mates and it seems queer, for somehow I've
always thought&mdash;you heard? She called us 'Mates,'
Minga."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the gypsy's prophecy making them
conscious, perhaps it was the green world surrounding
them like a round egg surrounding primal man and
woman. But they grew silent and awed as though
they walked toward a large surcharged destiny, so as
they halted the car and took out their lunch basket
they felt constrained; the rescue of Terence O'Brien
would not take place until nearly five o'clock; they
must pass the time alone together in this cathedral
solemnity of summer. They tried not to look at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
other for fear they should see in each other's eyes
things that would snatch away their control. They
stood a little away from each other, troubled, questioning,
half afraid, yet curious.</p>

<div class="center">"TERRY!"</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Evening</span> came heavily, the river, flattened to an
unearthly yellow calm, had thrown back all day field-heaviness,
the prolific scent of grasses. The house was
hot, the trees held lax droop of layered leaves.
Languidly in the tepid air moved hundreds of unseen
little ships of pollen, bringing to human breathing a
thickness as of a new element. The fire-flies carrying
their lanterns slowly up from dark grass, clotted beneath
a shrub, or hung in tiny constellations by a tree;
while out on the roadways the black automobiles
rolled pompously like haughty monsters whose eyes,
scornful and contemptuous, looked far ahead past all
poetry of tree and water toward future summer nights
when all the world should be a shattering brilliance of
moving engines.</p>

<p>The house seemed to ache with loneliness and the
desolation of souls at variance. There was no noisy
gathering of the Bunch on the porch of the Judge's
home. Miss Aurelia worried over the absence of
Minga and Dunstan. She had retired early to "collect
her thoughts," she told herself, supporting this enterprise
by taking with her a novel by which her friend,
Mrs. Spoyd, set great store and which, so its owner told
Miss Aurelia, contained "not one unpleasant thing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Miss Aurelia who read a chapter out of "Something"
every night, now read a blissful chapter out of this
novel. Here there were such minute descriptions of
crockery and curtains as delighted her soul; here married
people all "got on" well; in this book the children
arrayed in fresh pinks and blues played happily with
clean spools or pretty blocks against backgrounds of
hollyhocks. The little brooks ran without roiling, mad
dogs kept away from villages and arranged their lives
to be killed when convenient by intrepid lads educated
for the purpose. The minister was handsome, good
and healthy, and said what was expected, the doctor
cured all fractures whether of skull or mind, the tax
collector sent in his bills only when people had the
money, and the young people sprang up together in
couples like Noah's ark and married and started
on a wonderful advertisement-perfected housekeeping.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Miss Aurelia, yawning and settling
down for the night. "Why don't more people write
pleasant books and plays like this? I think all writers
who write disagreeable things should be snubbed and
made to feel uncomfortable, they should not be asked
to dinner nor treated politely in any way until they
stop writing about slums and dirty people and of unpleasant
married problems. That," said Miss Aurelia,
putting out the light, "would soon discourage them
from writing horrid books, and then life would become
normal and we should forget the things we don't want
to think about. I should think," soliloquized Miss
Aurelia, putting her handkerchief under her pillow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
"that writers should realize that unless they write
only about normal things that they will never be
popular."</p>

<p>It was after ten, but Sard had not gone up-stairs,
yet the figure of the Judge, sitting aloof in one corner
of the piazza, smoking and staring at the river, magnetized
while it antagonized her. Her father had not
spoken to her since the day Colter went away. The
girl believed that he knew in some way that she had
met Colter after his forbidding it. She could explain
the seeming disobedience of this final interview. She
wanted to explain it. With all the misery of her young
heart she wanted to explain.</p>

<p>Sard, moving wistfully under the great trees, looked
up into the branches spread over her. "What are
your laws?" she asked as of old. The girl, hot with
surging new things, with new blind impulses and
passions, asked but one thing, to be true to a law, to the
highest laws of all, yet the great law that called men
and women fiercely, insistently to each other seemed
to be set forever at variance with other laws, laws
that those same men and women themselves had made
and sustained. What should one be faithful to, what
repudiate?</p>

<p>"What shall be my laws?" whispered the girl. She
felt trembling that fierce law of blood and ardent spirit
that bade her follow Colter now, get to him if she
could, this night! Sard looked up, her eyes wide, her
body swept on the tidal streams of summer night, her
tremulous being still vibrated to the remembered clasp
of a man's hand, of the sense of mystery surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
that man, his unuttered call to her.... His truth
for her truth.</p>

<p>The isolation of youth, such as Sard's, is very great.
No human hand can help it. It walks a way of loneliness
that glimmers and is drenched with strange lights
that bewilder and if it comes to any help at all it is
the knowledge of the glory of loneliness, the glory of
the fighter, who at last prefers the sense of ambush
and the hazard of the wrong trail. Who prefers to
pierce the jungle and fight his way out into a clearing&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Yet to those who question the night, that time when
the earth is abandoned by its one angel, the sun, there
comes inevitably out of the dreaming quiet the one
word, Patience.</p>

<p>"Our law is Patience," said the trees to Sard. The
girl, a swift hand passed over her eyes, went in by way
of the terrace; she passed the dark form sitting there;
half pushing herself, half afraid she tiptoed toward
it, to make peace, to ask forgiveness. Then, as softly,
she tiptoed back; for deep in her heart Sard knew
that there would be only one condition of forgiveness,
that she repudiate the best and dearest thing that
had come into her life, she must give up Colter.</p>

<p>Now passion swept over against any calm she could
win, the girl saw vehemently that one man's face with
the look of gentleness and dumb pain. "I can't give
him up," she said fiercely. Sard drew a long breath;
she began climbing slowly up-stairs to bed.</p>

<p>As she stood at the foot of the tower room stairs the
hall clock struck eleven; there was a sudden whir of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
wheels and lights on the drive outside; she heard indistinctly
lowered voices of men, some long thing,
covered, was taken to the kitchen, sudden stir and
commotion ran like wild fire through the house.</p>

<p>Like a spell the summer night was breathless and
Sard was aware of heat and suffocation in her own
throat; the telephone began ringing, a man's voice
speaking with the Judge. Her father's questions and
commands were issued curt, annoyed, angry and then
finally hushed and with a knife-like anxiety the girl
flew to the head of the lower stair; there were slow
footsteps coming up into the upper hall. The light
fell upon a stretcher,&mdash;Dunstan&mdash;his boyish head
bloody, his mouth slightly open. Two men climbing
gently with something collapsed and, stricken in
their arms, the little huddled form of Minga. Suddenly
from the kitchen Dora's piercing wail, "Terry!
Terry!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div class="center">THE MEDE AND THE PERSIAN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> handsome man and woman that drove up to
the great door of the Bogarts' home got out with a
leisureliness that seemed the result of good nerve
structure rather than deliberate intention. Whatever
the anxiety in their hearts they did not show it in
gestures or voices. Mrs. Gerould, however, kept
rather intent eyes upon the electric bell; her gloved
finger pushed; she pulled the scarf around her
shoulders with a little nervous twitch. Her husband
flicked some dust from his shoes. The two talked in
low voices until the Bogarts' cook opened the door; as
they realized the absence of pretty Dora, their grave
faces grew more apprehensive.</p>

<p>Cook was expansive; she smoothed the sleeve of
Mrs. Gerould's silk motor coat. "Ye ain't been worried
about Minga, Mrs. Gerould? There's nothing the
matter with her, Praise be God!&mdash;only the fright, and
they've given her somethin' to sleep on. But him!
Oh, it seems that I can hear him callin' me now&mdash;Mr.
Dunstan&mdash;our bye&mdash;it was me he was always teasin'
and raisin' the divil wit." The cook trembled; she
burst out again:</p>

<p>"Gawd love him, the poor child wanted to save our
Terry, poor bye&mdash;now that wasn't no way to help,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
was it? Now, Mr. Dunstan's gone and got the law
onto himself, he's under arrest! But them two,"
the cook wiped her streaming eyes, "their little hearts
was broke over Terry bein' in the jug, and now look
at it&mdash;Terry's dead! Yes'm," cook's motherly heart
broke over it, her head went down into her red hands.
"The guards was after them when they got him in
the car, and fired. Yes'm, the poor boy's gorn. Well,
he's better aff, that's what I tell Dora, he's better aff!
I keep tellin' her that," blubbered cook.</p>

<p>The Mede and Persian looked increasingly grave.
The telegram had been telephoned to them and they
had stepped into a car and driven out at once without
much sense of tragedy&mdash;before this the two had been
hurried to scenes of Minga's dénouements, expecting
some result of physical rashness, of too much dancing,
or a bad sore throat and fever, some predicament of
finance easy of rescue, but here was a prank with
more serious development and one tragic result. Minga
and Dunce had played for high stakes this time; perhaps
their playing was forever over!</p>

<p>"Where's her room?" the two parents were at the
door before cook could get the directions out of her
mouth. On the way they encountered Miss Aurelia
carrying a hot-water bottle in her hand, a flask of
aromatic spirits of ammonia in the other. The lady
had been wandering about with these for hours; now
like a fountain of tears with fireworks of explanations
round it, she began sending up hysterical rockets.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Gerould, Minga will be glad&mdash;I don't
suppose I&mdash;you should talk to her now ... and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Mr. Gerould, how do you do? Sard will know; she is
with Minga&mdash;but our Dunstan, did you know? Had
you heard the&mdash;er particulars?&mdash;he&mdash;they, under arrest!"
Sobbing, Miss Aurelia, with that superb power
of tears that some people possess, talked through a
steady sliding of drops that ran down sluices of pale
cheeks until the two Geroulds in spite of anxiety looked
on admiringly&mdash;"the poor&mdash;er&mdash;criminal, Terry&mdash;is
dead&mdash;one can&mdash;er"&mdash;sniff,&mdash;"hardly grieve&mdash;but our
boy, our Dunstan"&mdash;sob&mdash;"is gravely injured&mdash;the
shoulders and head&mdash;fractures&mdash;they fear for his
life&mdash;&mdash;" To the gentle soothing of the Mede and
Persian, Miss Aurelia leaned like a wind-blown branch,
but the gusts of weeping came anew and the branch
merely swayed; the two newcomers after a while detached
themselves; with a sense of relief they stepped
into Minga's room.</p>

<p>Sard rose swiftly out of the dark; Mrs. Gerould
caught her two hands. "Minga's all right," the girl
whispered. "They gave her something quieting because
she was so horrified&mdash;Terry, you see&mdash;Terry
is dead." The young form straightened; Sard spoke
with grave calmness.</p>

<p>"Terry's troubles are over."</p>

<p>The Geroulds took her hands&mdash;together they spoke
encouragingly to her. "Dear, you've been such a
brick, we're proud of you; Eleanor Ledyard has told
us how you worked to save Terry, and you've done
our little Minga so much good." The big-hearted
man and woman longed to take the strained look of
tragedy from this young face. There were other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
things they knew that had turned Sard grave and old
in this one summer. They scanned her anxiously,
wishing she were not so set and stern. "When Dunstan
gets out of the woods,"&mdash;they patted her hands&mdash;"you
come to us for a while and&mdash;and&mdash;well, we want
to help."</p>

<p>This kind man and woman, understanding her,
standing by her, shook the girl to her depths. Sard's
lips trembled.</p>

<p>"I'd like to," she said, her eyes thrilled&mdash;"I'd like,"
Sard said simply, "to earn my own living; maybe you
would help me do that." Her eyes deepened and
thrilled, and in them the Geroulds read the old story,
Youth at bay, yet they heard her words, "But I
mustn't leave my father now&mdash;not now." Sard, with
a curious little gesture, motioned in the direction of
Dunstan's room.</p>

<p>"Of course not." Mrs. Gerould looked at her understandingly;
the tall, graceful woman went softly
over to the little bed and turned the night-light to see
her daughter's sleeping face. The little bobbed head
was deep in the pillows. Minga opened her eyes
slightly and drowsily closed them. "Sard," she spoke
with the curious distinctness of a person speaking under
a drug, "I thought the Mede and the Persian
were here&mdash;they are so dear&mdash;if they were here, you
know"&mdash;Minga spoke drowsily, "Dunstan would get
all right and Terry would come alive, the Mede and
the Persian would fix it. They&mdash;they are hummers."</p>

<p>The man and the woman looked long and lovingly
at her; then they looked at each other, shaking their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
heads, the little figure on the bed was so dear to
them, yet they, absorbed in their love for each other,
seemed to have so little power, so little direction over
her. This was their only child; she had had all the
care and love they could lavish on her, yet she seemed
as remote as an alien to all they believed and felt.
They, the Mede and Persian, were deliberate, slow-thinking
people of the agricultural age; Minga, the
one child of their union, was the strange electric vivacious
spirit of a machine age. It was this simple fact
that the couple hardly realized that made it impossible
for them to train their little daughter in the way they
thought she should go. Minga must train herself in
the way she would go. Somehow, they believed, she
would train herself right.</p>

<p>Sard, at last, remembered her duties as daughter of
the house. "Your room is all ready," she whispered;
"there's a nurse coming in here at about four and then
I shall go to bed." She led them down the hall, halting
ever so slightly outside Dunstan's door, half pausing
to hear the footsteps of the nurse on guard there,
explaining:</p>

<p>"The fracture isn't fatal, but it's a horrid splintered
one, and they must torture him some more to-morrow,
the car upset; it threw Minga free, but it fell on him&mdash;and
Terry's body&mdash;&mdash;" Sard drew a long shuddering
sigh.</p>

<p>Somewhat bewildered the two parents waited to
hear more. "But Terry," asked Mr. Gerould rather
desperately, "how was it he was with Dunstan and
Minga?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>"They had stolen him from a prison gang working
on the highway." It was curious that these three
desperately anxious people half smiled with appreciation
of Dunstan's and Minga's method, while they
realized its deadly solemnity. The two Geroulds
looked aghast.</p>

<p>"The prison guard shot him like a rabbit." The
girl turned a look of intense bitterness on the kindly
man and woman standing there. "You see," said
Sard, and her face and eyes were a mask of hardness,
"Terry was sentenced to twenty years in prison
at hard labor; it was thought to be a kind sentence;
he was under the law, and the law must not be
cheated." The girl's face was bitter in a way not
good to see. The Mede and the Persian did not,
however, meet it with cold logic. This was not a time
for that.</p>

<p>When they were alone in their room the Geroulds
locked the door and commenced talking to each other.
As the Persian slipped into a frilly dressing-robe and
groped in her bag for a flashlight, she cautioned the
Mede, "You turn in and sleep a lot, dear; the long
drive tired you. I'll come back in a few hours. I
want to relieve Sard and watch Minga and see how
she comes out of this."</p>

<p>The Mede acquiesced. Taking off his collar, he
sought for his tooth paste. "Apparently your daughter
is a body-snatcher," he remarked. "I'm glad I
sold that stock last week and that call money is improving.
I expect we'll have a lot of legal stuff on our
hands. It will be Minga's Christmas present keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
her out of jail. I'll try to see Shipman to-morrow and
find out what he thinks. Under arrest! your daughter,
Madam, is&mdash;ahem&mdash;exceptional."</p>

<p>"Your daughter when she is in trouble," remarked
the Persian blandly,&mdash;"I'm glad I have a permanent
wave; your daughter's activities make it necessary for
me to look my best at all times."</p>

<p>"Your daughter when she's discreditable, you
know," returned the Mede with decision. They
laughed. The Persian went over and rested her head
against the Mede's arm. "No wonder I want Minga
to be happy always," she said; "no wonder I've
spoiled her so. I've always been so ridiculously happy
and spoiled by you."</p>

<p>"You've been ridiculous, all right," said the Mede
with conviction. "I've been the happy one&mdash;well,"
he kissed her, then bit off the end of a cigar, "we've
got to pull Minga out of this scrape and read her the
riot act and make her sit up and face her iniquities,
by Jove!"</p>

<p>"You," the Persian looked back at him from the
door, "must scold her terribly, cut half her allowance
and forbid her to accept any more invitations for a
year. You remember, I always wanted you to punish
her when she was little."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did?" The Mede rummaged in the bathroom
for his safety razor; he now fitted this instrument
together, standing in dressing-gown surveying a
blue chin. "I am to put on the thumbscrews, am I?
Madam, I do not interfere with your peculiar offspring&mdash;&mdash;" The
Mede, looking in the glass, drew a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
ruminative thumb over his chin. "I am for helping
that poor child, Sard; she's a tigress in a crate here&mdash;I'm
going to help uncrate her."</p>

<p>The Persian, lingering by the door, laughed a little
helplessly. "Sard," she said in a low voice, "gives
me the shivers; that fearful kind of girl who wants to
reform the whole world before six o'clock, get life
laundered before dinner, you know."</p>

<p>"I do know," said the thoughtful Mede, "and it's
the kind I like; the kind that gets busy and doesn't
wait for George to do it. I was like that myself. I
mean, at Sard's age I wanted to reform the world. I
began by marrying you."</p>

<p>"You didn't let George do that! Do you want to
be pinched?" asked the Persian viciously.</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;come," said the Mede, "where are the
matches? After I have a smoke&mdash;Patty," he looked
toward the pretty rose-frilled figure at the door&mdash;"you
can't suppose our little duck is hurt anyway, do
you? They're not fooling us?" Mr. Gerould paused,
turning a rather worried face on his wife. He waved
the safety razor solemnly. That lady, to allay his
fears, came close up to him.</p>

<p>"Minga Gerould is my child," she said emphatically;
"she is made of rubber, the rest of her is steel,
her mind is a duck's back. Her will is a kite, her
imagination is fireproof, her humor is Charlie Chaplin
and her heart is sound."</p>

<p>"I believe you." The Mede tinkered with his razor
and looked about the room. "Rather comfy here,"
he remarked. "Who took the car to the garage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
anybody? I didn't lock it. Well, I guess there's no
need to worry; that fellow Colter is here yet, isn't he?
Eleanor Ledyard heard a lot about him from Watts;
thinks he may be her husband's brother. What rot you
women invent and you call it intuition. I keep worrying
about Sard's face. I'd like to get a look at the
fellow. Did you say you wanted to kiss me again?"</p>

<p>"I did not," said the Persian, her soft eyes challenging
him. "But I could give Minga another kiss
for you when she wakes up. I am willing to do that,"
said the Persian with an air of benevolence.</p>

<p>"You will do what I tell you," said the Mede belligerently.
He pulled the tall rosy lady toward him
and lifted her face to his. "My life," said the Mede,
"is a wreck between the two demons, wife and
daughter." He pressed a second kiss on a face that
seemed the rosier by something in that second kiss.</p>

<p>The two looked at each other with a sudden deep
look of laughing devotion. Such things do sometimes
happen!</p>

<div class="center">PENALTIES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sard</span> came into Dunstan's room with the mail. The
nurse, a calm-faced, serious woman of mature years,
smiled at her. "I'm glad you've come; we're getting
a little sick of each other."</p>

<p>The haggard face of the boy looked out from the
surgeon's trestlework of the fractured arm and shoulder.
"Drool!" said the weak voice querulously.
"Drool! she means that I've been nagging her until
she's half crying." The lad looked his sick mortification;
he knew he could not control his peevishness,
not just yet. He tried to cover it with the old impishness.
"Never mind, Miss Crayden, try to imagine
I'm your husband; let me, the tender partner of your
life, wipe up the floor with you."</p>

<p>In spite of the humorous quirk around the mouth,
the nurse seemed glad to get away. She did not deny
his self-accusation. "If you're going to be around
for a while," to the sister, "I think I'll just take a
brisk walk."</p>

<p>"Take a brisk walk" after the all-night vigil, "take
a brisk walk" that late August day with its breathless
depths of dusty overgrowth, its sultry world of tapestried
leaf hangings. The thing made the youthful
ones smile. Dunce looked after the retreating form,
firm and crisp in its white uniform, murmuring&mdash;"A
brisk walk&mdash;at ninety-two in the shade."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>"She kids herself along pretty well, doesn't she?"
demanded the invalid; then as his weak voice went
into a squeak,&mdash;"Say, how long I got to hang here
like a dry worm on the end of a fish-hook? Oh, Sard,
when does this rotten weakness end? Say, why don't
you get me some dog poison and put me out of my
misery?"</p>

<p>There was a haunted look in the boy's eyes that
tried to smile listlessly as he pawed over his mail.
"Letter from Bumpy Dodge asking about college.
Well, I guess I don't get back to college&mdash;&mdash; No,
Bumpy, old sport, I guess I do a turn in jail, what?"
He looked questioningly at his sister. "Nothing from
Minga, I suppose? Well, I don't blame her; I did
get her into a mess, the newspaper rot and all. I
wonder," said Dunstan soberly, "what I was thinking
of," he looked at Sard curiously, "I wonder if
I thought at all. I don't believe I did think&mdash;I just
felt, and feeling isn't the whole show, I guess. Well,
Minga and I certainly gummed the game." The figure
lying trussed in a bower of splints and bandages
was silent a moment. "Gimme a cigarette, Sardine,"
then, at her denying look, "Why, haven't they
lifted the ban yet? Say, when does this surgeon Sunday-school
end, anyway? You'd think those tinkering
old 'Docs' were women the way they go on.
Why, in the war they gave the chaps cigarettes in their
very coffins, and me with just a cracked rib and a little
allegro adrumata medulla medusa Madonna crackiosis&mdash;can't
have a smoke."</p>

<p>It was not the old Dunce so much as his determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
imitation of the Dunce that had been. A young chap
of nineteen cannot go through the experience of having
a man of his own age shot to death across his
knees without some changes which, in spite of modern
science, we will assume are more than chemical. With
the sinking down of Terence O'Brien's fair, curly
head, his gasping, his blood sprinkled over the car in
its crazy speed, the crash, their own capture, and in his
own mortal pain seeing the fugitive lying beside him,
blood pouring out of his mouth, his eyes closing on the
warm summer sunset&mdash;with this picture, Dunstan's
inner youth closed. His boy's body, badly cracked
and shaken, could be mended, made almost perfect
again, but his soul with the one great wound in it now
stood up and commanded strong meat for its sustenance.
Under the law! Dunstan must now stand
face to face with law!</p>

<p>In his first interview with his father, with his knowledge
of the process of this law, came the sense of rising
to punishment that he felt able, nay, glad to meet.
After almost twenty years, and twenty years did not
seem long against the years Terry had lost, after
twenty years of glad life Dunstan instead of bringing
freedom had brought death to the wild, young Irish
lad; he, who had had the advantages of education, of
some measured temperate views of life; he, who for a
reckless impulse had not considered what it is a man
or woman puts in motion when they start out to defy
the accepted law, now saw reasons for law.</p>

<p>Such parts of the long frame as were not pinned in
plaster writhed. Dunstan's thoughts went to Minga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>&mdash;what
did she think of it all? Did she feel the same
way, like one carrying a great burden? The bullet
of the guard who had shot Terry had barely escaped
Minga's head before the car had overturned and he,
Dunstan, who ought by his very man's nature to have
protected her, had brought her into all this. Oh, he
was a nice chap, a splendid fellow. Ah, well, civilization
was a trap anyway, a scheme, a plan to defeat
frank square things. The thing to do was to cast off
the whole silly rot, get off somewhere, where a man
got out of the cheap lying pattern of things, where a
man really lived, realized himself, rode, killed, loved,
hated without a pink worsted design to remind him
that he had "broken the law."</p>

<p>Sard looked over at him. "Stop squirming!" she
ordered sternly, then&mdash;"Dear old Pirate, don't you
know that convalescing is the hardest time of all?"
She went over to the bed, scrutinizing her brother.
"Is the light in your eyes?" she asked anxiously.
"Shall I read to you? Do you want a fresh drink?"</p>

<p>"I want a fresh Hades," growled the invalid. "I
want&mdash;&mdash;" All of a sudden Dunstan's face broke;
he could not move, but lay here shaking. The girl,
looking away from him, was silent.</p>

<p>"If Minga would only write," at last he groaned.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she doesn't know what to say," comforted
the sister.</p>

<p>"Dunce," said Sard thoughtfully; she stood by the
bed. "Dunce," in a mild patience unlike her, "I
guess you and I are up against it, aren't we? We
must have, somewhere, ancestors not like Dad and lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>tle
Mother and Aunt Aurelia, race-horse ancestors
that wanted things to happen and to happen quick
bang, right off, and they don't, they just won't. No
matter what we do, we have to wait, no matter how
much we care," said Sard slowly, "we just have to
wait; everybody has to wait, I guess. It's a sort of
law."</p>

<p>"Terry didn't wait," said Dunce bitterly; "he,
thank God, got out."</p>

<p>"I've been reading," she returned thoughtfully,
she was trying to draw him out of this mood, "a
book that tells how Venice grew up out of the sea;
and it seems like life somehow. The streams came
down from the mountains carrying grains, just grains,
Dunce, of sand, and the ice and snow rolled down
more clay and sand, all the currents of the sea kept
carrying deposits to one spot until," absorbedly the
girl recounted the dreamy geologic tale, her eyes fixed
on distance. Dunstan heard her through patiently.</p>

<p>"Sounds like the rags old Colter used to chew," he
said, not uninterestedly. "By the way, Sard, what
became of that mucker; turned out to be a ne'er-do-well,
after all? What?"</p>

<p>His companion was silent. Something in her face
contracted as she tried to answer lightly. "Oh, I
guess he's all right. Mr. Shipman has been following
him up. He was ill after he left here. Then he went
to work somewhere, and then I don't exactly know,"
said Sard. "Mr. Shipman is keeping his eye on him.
I don't exactly know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The invalid tried to change his position. "That so?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Got him work, did he?" he asked. "Say, ain't Shipman
the dear old prophet? By Gad, Sardine, what
makes a gray-headed chap like that and what makes
an old spinny like Miss Crayden homely, you
know, and out of the game, what makes 'em do all
they can for you and not cuss you back when you cuss
and not let you get the blue devils, but hold umbrellas
of hope over you and keep reminding you of another
You that's back of you, sort of, and ringing up your
good deeds like spiritual fares and everything. Say,"
said Dunstan earnestly, "I want to know. These old-timers,
there ain't much in it for them. They must
know it. Why in thunder do they keep making everybody
on the Merry-go-round think they are going to
get the Gold Ring?"</p>

<p>His sister laughed. Sard, perching on Dunstan's
bed, thoughtfully traced out the pattern of the white
counterpane. The girl, thinner, with a look of limpid
patience in the brook-clear eyes, tried to answer the
question to herself. What, indeed, had made Shipman,
who she had guessed was a baffled, lonely man,
turn from his own concerns to help and encourage
her? Why should he, to whom she could give nothing,
keep the dark eyes with their look of "courage"
so fixed upon her that even when he was not there
she saw the look, heard the words and knew that the
lawyer's strength and help were hers to call upon?
Sard did not know that Watts Shipman, after Colter's
collapse and his subsequent recovery and revelations,
had been to Judge Bogart's with astounding news.
The lawyer had sat in the Judge's library giving fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
after fact of the distinction, nay, the actual academic
fame of the Judge's hired man.</p>

<p>"He's chipper enough now," he placidly told the
Judge; "he's enormously improved! Last time I saw
him he was walking up and down the campus at a reunion,
laughing and talking with old comrades." The
lawyer fixed rather scrutinizing eyes on his superior.
"You wouldn't," he said tentatively, "I beg your pardon
if I interfere, but your daughter is so noble, so
superb a little fighter. You wouldn't stand in the way
now&mdash;of anything?"</p>

<p>There was a long silence. The Judge, some obstinacy
in his throat, sat staring ahead of him. The new
sense of Sard, a girl, a young unformed girl, having
somehow gotten at the fine intelligence and soul that
had dwelt concealed in this man, staggered him.</p>

<p>Meticulously Shipman had given him every detail.
Dr. Martin Ledyard's heroic effort to save his friends
from the terrible scourge of Congo smallpox, the desertion
of the natives with canoes, the subsequent shock
of learning of his brother's trouble and suicide, the
fever in the hospital, his sudden rising and escape with
only the clothes he wore from the beginning of convalescence,
the tale of his long wandering from farm
to farm, the half sustained body and mind a blank, the
exposure and terror of a partial memory, were things
that Shipman had gotten from Ledyard's own lips bit
by bit, and they had been confirmed by the specialist to
whom the lawyer had taken Colter. That the eminent
scientist had completely recovered, a recovery that had
begun the very hour that Sard had recognized him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
he sat on the village curb for what he was, was an established
medical fact. "Surely," Watts Shipman
leaned forward, the face he bent on the Judge was
solemn, "you could not interfere with your daughter's
happiness now. Ledyard," said the lawyer mildly,
"is not likely to come to her until he has your permission."</p>

<p>"Sard," said the Judge, his eyes had a light of the
book of Moses in them, "Sard is to come to her father
and acknowledge her impatience and disrespect."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" The lawyer rose. He walked to the
window and looked out. Then, his mouth torn between
rage and amusement, he said politely, "Ahem!
I don't exactly see how she could under the circumstances
do that exact thing."</p>

<p>"That is all I ask," said the Judge finally. No
sense of the ridiculous came to his rescue. He got up,
went to a bookshelf and took down book after book,
examined its cover for dust and blemish, and returned
it without opening to the shelf. It was a curious habit
of the Judge's to do this when deep in thought.
Somehow it was like his treatment of human beings,
thought Shipman.</p>

<p>"As for my son," remarked the gray-lipped mouth,
"he will learn, he will learn something about the
Law." Judge Bogart went back to his chair. He sat
down, stretched out his legs and fixed his look upon
the other man. "He will learn something about the
Law," said he implacably. "I have done nothing to
spare him," said the Judge with an air of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Yet Dunstan's first interview with his father had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
not had all this quality of implacability. The boy's
fever over, his limbs lightened of certain casts and the
eyes deep and haunted, were things to meet which the
older man had braced, things from which the Judge,
with all his hardness, had shrunk; even the judicial
habit could not overlook the danger the Judge had
been in, of losing his son, the man who bore his name.
With a curious sense of pride he, himself, could not
understand, a perception of the absurd gallantry, the
chivalry underlying the actions of a fool breaker of
laws, the old man, his own prerogatives negatived, had
fairly to screw up his courage to begin the interview
as he determined it should be begun.</p>

<p>"You know that you will have to meet the penalty,"
he rasped.</p>

<p>The dark eyes met the gooseberry ones squarely.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I've looked the thing up."</p>

<p>"It is likely," said the Judge dryly, "that you will
have to give up college and go into business, if indeed
you are spared incarceration. The fine is very heavy;
you are, in spite of bail, under arrest."</p>

<p>At the word "incarceration" a swift gleam in Dunstan's
eyes gave his father absurd hope. He was not
injured, then&mdash;he was&mdash;all right&mdash;that was the old
impudence, curse it.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad," said the young fellow slowly, "to
take any penalty that is rightfully mine, that would
come to any man that did what I did, that had," the
boy gulped a moment, "that had broken the law he
lived <i>under</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah," the old gray face, the hard-boiled eyes, looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
watchfully upon the young face with its fierce pride&mdash;"then
you realize that you were a fool, that you risked
my name, your own honor, to save from just punishment
a ruffian who had broken the law?"</p>

<p>Something wild, desperate, leaped into the face on
the pillows; it was a hurt, appealing look, different
from Sard's fiery pride and steady intention; it was
not so defiant, it was the more helpless and miserable,
as who would say, "I am punished enough." The
Judge's eyes on the thin young face at sight of this
look felt a sudden strange pang. It reminded him
of&mdash;</p>

<p>"We love Foddy&mdash;Foddy won't put us in prison
with the naughty prisoners."</p>

<p>Oh, little woman lips; oh, soft little hands and sweet
voice; oh, hundred innocent tendernesses and faiths
and needs&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Judge stared at his son; the dark eyes closed
and Dunstan lay there like death, only one long, thin
hand clenched and unclenched on his chest.</p>

<p>They rise up sometimes, these who were our forbears
and become our good angels; when we need
them and call sincerely they rise up in our eyes and
hearts and speak for us. If we have kept the house
garnished and clean only the best of them will come
to us bearing in their hands lamps to light our paths;
when we call out in sheer agony for light and leading,
all the noblest and fairest of our line rise up for a
hundred comforting and strengthening ministries, to
lead us on our blind path. Dunstan's mother, standing
in his lad's eyes, had risen once and looked at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
husband. "Dearest," said the little timid voice,
"what are you doing with my son&mdash;our boy? Treat
our little Dunstan fairly."</p>

<p>For a long time the old Judge stood at the window,
the gray lips trembling, the gooseberry eyes desperately
blinking. "The heart bowed down with weight
of woe," thought the Judge, "I will go down and
play that record&mdash;she&mdash;she was fond of it."</p>

<p>At last he turned toward his son's bed. "There,"
said the Judge. He cleared his throat with a rasp
that could have been heard in the garage. "Hum&mdash;I&mdash;I
guess I've been breaking a law, too, hey?" He
glanced up at the nurse who had just entered. "I
don't want to disobey the doctor's laws." He stood
for a moment looking down at his son. "I have a
letter from that little vixen Minga," said Dunstan's
father; then as he saw the slow red creep into the
boy's cheek, "I think&mdash;ahem&mdash;I think she shows
character&mdash;she seems to realize that her conduct was&mdash;I'll
send it up to you," said the Judge. He held out
his hand. "You and I must protect Minga," he said
slowly; "we must keep her out of this thing. Hey,
What? Have her out here, hey? Cheer us up
some&mdash;hey&mdash;What?"</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other; under their differing
ages was the same cool facing of facts. Dunstan
did not turn from his knowledge of himself, a man
who had incurred the penalty of the law; neither did
the Judge as father turn from that fact. Facts are
sometimes the most wholesome curative things of life.
When two people resolutely face them together, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the same degree of earnestness and honesty, they construct
a bridge over great abysses of distrust, misunderstanding
and heart-break.</p>

<p>The Judge started for the door. "Take care of
yourself," he said as he looked wistfully at those dark
eyes that had held just for one moment the dear wife's
look. Then the Judge remembered Dunstan's love of
a joke. "If you ever steal a murderer again," he
said, "I'll thrash you within an inch of your life."</p>

<p>It was a joke! It was made with an effort; the very
machinery creaked and the finished product looked
dusty and wizened, but it was a joke! Dunstan, the
dark-eyed humorist, saw it and grinned. The Judge
returned to the bed. Two hands went spontaneously
out, a grim, dry, purple one and a slim, thin, weak one.
They clinched&mdash;then the door closed and the Judge
went down-stairs.</p>

<p>Late that evening Miss Bogart heard the phonograph
circling forth the "heart bowed down with
weight of woe."... She turned another page in
the "pleasant" book. "My poor brother," said Miss
Aurelia to herself; "he seems to turn naturally to the&mdash;er&mdash;melancholy&mdash;but
I should think," the lady
thought sleepily, "that now that Colter isn't Colter at
all, but the celebrated scientist Dr. Ledyard, that he,
she, they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<div class="center">THE JUDGE IS IMPRESSED</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late September; the yellow maples threw
gold on sky and ground; oaks and hickories were mantled
in ruddy purples. Along the banks of the river
the solemn procession of outgoing summer was begun;
on dry nights mountain fires spread crackling smoky
fringes. The Westchester hills, the hills of Pocantico,
were trailed in grape-colored mists; bloom was on the
Ramapos; amethystine smokes along the Highlands
and the Palisades.</p>

<p>There was drowse and arrest in the air, a kind of
heat that was different from summer, more dazing,
more intensely keyed, with greater power to make one
restless. Sard, lying on her couch in the tower-room,
felt as if a world was closing in on her, as if the sky
pressed and the hills leaned to smother. She had
been reading to Dunstan, for the first time sitting up
in his wheeled chair, had seen him drift off to sleep,
and had then put down her book with an unconquerable
sense of listlessness, of lack of purpose that had
somehow closed in on her.</p>

<p>The girl, her body and mind built for action, for
creative and progressive things, found herself victimized
by a slowly narrowing circle of life, static, unimaginative,
unprogressive; she was the fiery center of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
a wooden wheel of existence that revolved in accustomed
sameness with no effort, to no purpose.</p>

<p>"When Dunstan gets well," thought Sard desperately,
"when Dunstan doesn't need me, what shall I
do then? Aunt Aurelia doesn't really need me, Father
will have nothing to do with me unless I&mdash;just&mdash;just
capitulate. And I can't do that. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>The girl's mind, shrinking from her father's idea of
her, went over the situation; the only way to clear up
that situation was to say she had been mistaken in
Colter, that she proudly told herself she could never
do. But supposing Colter never came back, never&mdash;came&mdash;back
to Willow Roads? Life would go on the
same and, of course, one could adapt one's self to anything;
with a shiver the girl tried to think what this
adaptation would mean.</p>

<p>As far as those of her own group were concerned,
there was no life. All mingling with the Bunch was
over. Life, then, would mean social cliques and
women's clubs, more or less boss controlled, politically
influenced, "run" by one or two personalities,
powerful in prestige but prejudiced and limited as to
opportunity or progress. In such gatherings the girl
instinctively felt there could be nothing constructive
for her; the chemistry of these organizations was controlled
by the acids of personal dislike or preference,
or jealousy. Little careful nothings of possessions or
dress were the intellectual meat of these associations,
the inhibitions of the mentally torpid or the censorious
attitude of the unimaginative virtuous. None of these
things attracted a girl of Sard's impulse, a soul that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
demanded fine contacts, the eager mingling of men
and women in associations of tolerance and forward
looking, the stimulus of persons of vivid experience.
Sard mentally said "No" to it all.</p>

<p>Yet it was characteristic of her inherent nobility
that she should attempt to force herself to an interest
in these home matters, to attempt to form herself
humbly on that narrow model. "It isn't nice to be
choosy and exclusive," thought the girl; "real people
are never that. I mustn't be 'superior,' whatever I
do." She bent puzzled brows. "What would Colter
have thought to be the right thing, to stay here and
grow smaller and more timid and with less fresh impulse,
or to break away, earn my own living, and,
from Father's point of view, forfeit my right to my
home?" "Ah! what would Colter think?" That
was the sentence that dominated all Sard's life now.</p>

<p>From under her pillow the girl drew a letter from
Watts Shipman&mdash;eagerly her eye sought one passage&mdash;one
she had read and reread:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I must not tell you all the circumstances, they are
not mine to tell. Colter will want to tell you himself,
but I have been able to help a little and I am rejoiced
for the man you helped to save. Our friend Colter
has surely come into his own, Miss Sard, and it is
rather a magnificent Own. I do congratulate you on
your discrimination in tramps. I suspect you have
created a tradition that will some day be like a final
degree. 'In 19&mdash; he was discovered by Miss Sard
Bogart, which justified his previous achievements in a
blaze of glory. Forgive me for being enigmatic.
Courage! Miss Winged Victory, that you may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
happy in a parlous world is the deep wish of your true
friend,
"<span class="smcap">Watts Shipman</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sard went over it hungrily for the hundredth time.
She knew this paragraph by heart; it swept her with
impatient excitement. Why was it all so obscure?
Why was so little told her? Had Colter really found
himself? What was that real self? The girl's heart
stood still; perhaps since Watts wrote this something
had happened....</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on; the girl, with an ejaculation,
sprang up. "What do I mean by loafing around
like this?" Sard inquired hotly. "Colter never loafed,
he was always busy mending, rearranging, working,
studying. I can't stand this lazy life, I won't, I won't
just drift; I will be like Colter."</p>

<p>She went into the little dressing-room and bathed
her face, looking with wonder into the eyes grown so
dark and wide, so strangely listening and startled.
She flung open a drawer and lifted out a clean white
dimity, a frock with fresh frills and a soft sash. Sard
rustled into it with a little winged sense of pining for
the air, to be moving, going somewhere, experiencing
something. But the soft white seemed vapid to the
serious brown eyes so unaware of their own vitality.
Sard, frowning upon this absence of color, opened a
casket and took out a long rope of cut amber beads.
Her mother's necklace, a thing honey-like with sun-color,
quivering with golden lights. "Funny," thought
the girl, ruminatively, "I never cared to wear these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
before." She ran the smooth clicking morsels of amber
through caressing fingers. "Little Mother," she
thought tenderly, "I suppose these reached almost to
your knees; they hardly come to my waist. I'm not a
bit like you."</p>

<p>With yearning face, the girl turned to her bookshelves.
Sard vaguely thought of going down to the
river edge to read. The young fingers paused over
"The Sonnets from the Portuguese"; not until this
summer had Sard understood these exquisite verses.
Now, almost with reverence she drew the volume
forth. It was a girl's way to evade all the cold questions,
all the sneering comments, the Gorgon stare of
"practical life." With some sense of being companioned
by the little book, Sard gave a touch here and
there to her pretty room, patted a pillow, pulled down
a shade and started to leave it.</p>

<p>Miss Aurelia's flat heels clapped up the stairs; the
face that met Sard's look was mystified and potential.
Her aunt, taking a chair, gasped a little.</p>

<p>"Aunt Reely," scolded Sard, "how you pant; you
take these stairs too fast. I do believe you get more
tired than you let us see; you've got to go easier," said
Sard in gentle bullying.</p>

<p>The girl these days had been wistfully tender of her
aunt. Sard had great need to be tender to someone.
Miss Aurelia exulted in the solicitude. "Sard and I
are very much alike," she had told Mrs. Spoyd; "we
are congenial." The timid lady exulted in what
seemed to her like the opening of a new régime. To
have Sard's companionship in all her little flutters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
wonderings and excitements! Miss Aurelia had carefully
swept up Sard's heart for her. Everything to
the aunt's perception was neatly ticketed and put
away; all reminiscence of that er&mdash;unfortunate&mdash;er, infatuation
for the "Man on the Place." Now, however,
the rabbity mouth looked awed. Miss Aurelia
was more uncertain than usual; she eyed Sard irresolutely.</p>

<p>"Someone has er&mdash;called&mdash;could you go down at
once&mdash;I see you are presentable. I&mdash;you see," said
Miss Aurelia with elaboration, "I am very untidy."</p>

<p>Miss Bogart was invariably perfectly groomed and
arranged; Sard giggled in derision.</p>

<p>"Aunt Reely, what more could you do to be 'presentable,'
as you call it?"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;er&mdash;hands," explained Miss Aurelia, with
curious firmness&mdash;"I have been polishing those little
Chinese brasses on my desk and they&mdash;&mdash;" She displayed
fingers that looked immaculate, but which she
insisted smelled of brass polish. "It takes so long to
get off. Now, if you could run down," insisted the
lady mildly.</p>

<p>"Of course." The girl ran a comb through her
tawny hair. "Don't you know who it is?"</p>

<p>"Dora said some name like the minister's, I thought.
Or was it a lady? I did not pay attention." Miss
Aurelia sniffed violently at her fingers. "Phew,
phew! Sometimes I think they should invent a brass
polish that is odorless. You never know when you've
got rid of it. Could you go down at once? It seems
so rude to keep them&mdash;him&mdash;waiting, and I always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
think," said Miss Aurelia nervously, "that when one is
not sure the living-room is dusted, it is better to give
him&mdash;her&mdash;them&mdash;less time to look about."</p>

<p>It was not different from her aunt's usual incoherence.
Sard hardly noticed the tremor, the little excited
pat. She went slowly down the stairs across the
hall, pushing back the heavy portière of the living-room.</p>

<p>The man who turned from the window and came
toward her did not wear an old gray flannel shirt and
khaki trousers. He was clad in the white flannels that
make a man look taller, lighter, of a cooler vigor and
grace. The hair that swept back from his forehead
was a bright chestnut, and his face was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sard stood half turning for flight. The man did
not yet take her hand, but he looked swiftly into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Was it unfair to come like this?" he demanded.
It was evident that he could hardly leash the note of
gladness in his voice. "Miss Aurelia thought it better
not to tell you, that if you knew you might not come
down." There was unutterable tenderness in the light
of those eyes. "I could not wait," the man admitted
quickly.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, in which she stood
staring at him. This was Colter, the Man on the
Place. This was <i>not</i> Colter. This was a glad, confident
person, who, something came into Sard's throat,
was sure&mdash;sure of everything. Much younger,
much more buoyant than that one she had known!
And, too sure!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>The tall man looked at her, his expression changing
slightly. Then as he glanced at the hand she had not
offered him, "I&mdash;I have been talking with your father,"
he said quietly.</p>

<p>Sard tried to smile back, tried to smile in greeting,
sympathy, but her heart pounded. She was instinct
for flight, a thing suddenly confronted with strangeness,
facing someone who was&mdash;too eager! Slight as
the hesitation was, the man saw it. He did not move
except with great gentleness to draw her to a chair.
He stood speaking tranquilly, with a curious authority
Sard had never seen before. It made her thrill. "I
have been talking to Judge Bogart," this triumphant
man in white flannels said easily; "he gave me permission
to see you. I have told him about myself;
you see," he smiled, "I have found out who I am!
Sard, aren't you glad? Don't you care?"</p>

<p>"You have found out&mdash;who you are?" said the
girl thickly, childishly. Her gaucherie was painful to
her and evident and very dear to the man perceiving
it. The deep fire-blue eyes rested on hers a moment.
An indefinable softness crept into them, replacing that
look of confidence and power. The tall frame bent a
little toward her, and she was aware as of a curious
tenseness of resolution&mdash;a self-control such as she had
felt that night in the little fruit orchard. Colter, who
looked at her with understanding, knew that for the
moment his chiefest hold on Sard was gone. Drinking
her down with a thirst born of his knowledge of
her, yet this triumphant man before her realized that
now that he no longer had need of her compassion she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
had as yet no other kind of passion for him! The
dark days being over, Martin Ledyard, the scientific
adventurer, whose name was famous all over the
world, was standing irresolute, abashed, not able, it
seemed, to win back the bright look of pity from the
brook-clear eyes, the little maternal cadence in a girl's
voice. He saw her disturbed, at bay.</p>

<p>If, however, he felt taken aback, disappointed, there
was no hint of it. He looked at her with unutterable
tenderness, the kind of look Sard had never before
seen on a man's face. "I see," he said simply, "you
don't care for me&mdash;so much&mdash;in my triumph. You
think that now I do not need you, Sard? Not need
you, my Happiness? Sard," she quivered at her
name on his lips, "are you sorry you saved me, sorry
I came&mdash;back?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. She had risen. It was like
them both that they should take it standing, trying to
be square with each other, striving to get to the thing
that lay between them. The Judge, passing through
the hall, on an uneasy excited walk, coughed gruffly.
Hearing this cough, with a strange feeling of unreality,
Sard tried to realize what had happened. There
was her father outside, not caring that she was with
this man. Why&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;the Judge knew then
that she had read true!</p>

<p>"You say you have talked with Father?" A
wild wave of relief tore through the girl; she
tried once more to lift her eyes to the face, reading
the wistful look dwelling on it, loving it, yet coming
no nearer to it. Ah, there would be no more Gorgon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
"practical life" now. She had seen true, she had
known, <i>known</i>&mdash;and with a curious effort the girl tried
to look smilingly and frankly back at this man. On
"Colter's" own face there was left only a trace of
the old baffled sadness; new triumph tore through her,
"Colter" had won out, <i>won out!</i> As in a dream,
she listened to his voice.</p>

<p>"I hoped you and I might care for all the 'under-dogs'
in the world&mdash;together."</p>

<p>Then after another short silence:</p>

<p>"You remember the night in the little fruit orchard?
I think you cared for me then, and I," the
man's voice faltered, "I adored you. You remember
other times, I think," he said gently, "that you <i>did</i>
care and I wanted you to know that that was what
cured me, brought things back. I didn't frighten
you then, did I, Sard? You put your hand in mine,
but," hesitatingly, "I seem to frighten you now; you
wouldn't come to me now?"</p>

<p>She stood pulling at the amber chain, and after a
moment "Colter" also touched the chain. He followed
her hand on the golden rope. It seemed to
them both that something rather terrible might happen.
To Sard, it was as if in this pause some wonderful
gate might close, some beautiful thing might pass out,
never to return. But the woman that rose up in the
girl asserting with vehemence her right to this man
frightened that other untried creature, the Winged
Victory of freedom and innocent impulses. Things
had changed!</p>

<p>Oh, how could Sard prevent the gate from closing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
the lovely thing from ending, unless she did the thing
that it seemed to her she could not do? Instinctively
the girl looked to him for help; but he, it seemed,
either could not or would not help. No, "Colter"
would not make it easy for her.</p>

<p>"I came too suddenly," said he decisively; there
was a stern note of self-condemnation. "Dear, I
wasn't fair to you; I should have thought things out,"
stammered the man. A swift look of sorrow swept
over his face. "Things aren't quite the same, are
they?" He hesitated.</p>

<p>Oh, no, they were not the same; they were not the
same! The girl's heart, plunging, recognized this.
It has been so easy to be tender to a baffled, helpless
man, someone in trouble; it was so hard to meet
this strange, glad, powerful person who attracted
her like fatal fire, who, some way, had mastery of
her.</p>

<p>The gruff cough sounded again outside, the curtain
was pulled aside and the Judge entered. He had a
furtive air of curiosity and exultation. It was plain
he could not keep his hands off. "Hum&mdash;ha&mdash;&mdash;"
he said. "I've been comparing your&mdash;um&mdash;papers
with Mr. Shipman's&mdash;very strange experiences, very
strange experiences! Well, sir, I'm glad you came
out as you have." The Judge, realizing that he addressed
Martin Ledyard, a man whose name ranked
high in universities all over the world, was almost
humble. He stood straighter, his gooseberry eyes
shot honest congratulation. Down deep in his heart,
like all men, he honored the man of adventure, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
than the man of science. He could not, however,
keep the ring of pride from his voice as he turned
benevolently to his daughter.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you." The Judge blew his nose; he
pushed his handkerchief back in his pocket. He
stared rather nervously at Sard. "Hum&mdash;you've
made a distinguished friend."</p>

<p>The blunt, carefully-concealed apology went home.
Sard drew a long, fluttering breath. This was the
man who had stood between her and the world all her
life; this was the hard, stern man who had made life
possible and impossible for her, who had hindered and
ignored and indulged and scouted her; who had insulted
and protected her! Some sense of the conflicting
laws of parenthood got to Sard's heart, something
new and keen leaped to life, this man's blood
ran through her veins, something mysterious, a great
bond, connected them. Ah! it was the Law. In spite
of everything it was the Law! "We love Foddy, little
Sard." It was the Law!</p>

<p>"Dad," said the girl breathlessly, "you&mdash;you know
now?"</p>

<p>Sard sobbed just once. It was like her to fly to
this stern man, to bury her tawny head on his breast.
The Judge detached himself, resolutely, with decision.
Women did these things, they were to all logic absurd.
What did another man, under such circumstances, do?
The gooseberry eyes rather shamefacedly consulted
the quiet eyes of "Colter." "There," said the Judge
to his daughter, "there, I don't know what all this is
about!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>But the other man knew, and he knew that when
the Judge made his embarrassed exit that there was no
one for Sard to turn to but him! Therefore, when
she, with that little desperate sob, did turn, she did not
see his face, for he, somehow, contrived that her own
could be hidden. "Colter's" arms tightened about
her and his lips whispered on her hair. "I think,"
said the man softly, "that if we are very quiet we can
hear the river freshening." It was the old remembered
voice, like a quieting hand laid on her. It was
the voice that had spoken that midsummer night in the
orchard. Sard, with a little quivering sigh, gave herself
to it.</p>

<p>No one saw the Judge that evening, but afar off the
phonograph could be heard playing, "The Heart
Bowed Down With Weight of Woe." Miss Aurelia
paused to say "Good-night" to Dunstan. "I always
feel relieved when I hear your father playing that
tune," she remarked. "It is an indication that he is
feeling better, that his mind is relieved. This, ahem,
affair of Sard's is&mdash;er&mdash;very interesting; Mrs. Spoyd,
now that she knows the particulars, says that to her
it is&mdash;er&mdash;most affecting!"</p>
